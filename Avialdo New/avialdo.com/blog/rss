        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Being a great place to work is not easy, but the real challenge stems from the fact that people—especially the young and talented people—are not very well equipped to deal with the status quo. Which is to say, many people are only happy when things are improving.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Constant improvement being what any organisation should strive for, what’s the problem?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Let me rephrase; people are only <em>really happy</em> when things are <em>really improving</em>. The higher you climb on the tree of happiness, the more difficult it becomes to find any significant improvements to work life.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Here’s a chart that is not based on real data. I just drew it to prove my point, as this is how you do it in 2016:</p>

<p> </p>

<p dir="ltr"><img alt="chart-worklife-quality-paint-blur.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j8gXYRiLuvukzc6zey_asvgUC1ndXdtxFyfnIzXJMxN1wl-WJHB_7WWeMRvFnH-KObkF8hGKVVI1KOuHpTtPW7sttSl_8KmOVtHhOHel71JO8YrXQzoDtFwt5WtkAppJeYcct0PF"></p>

<p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">The point I am flawlessly proving is that happiness decays. Keeping up with that decay easily becomes a Red Queen’s race.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>"Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."</em></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>"A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"</em></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>-- Lewis Carroll</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">While your organisation climbs up this Great Employer ladder, it soon becomes insufficient just to come up with new perks and avoid upsetting anyone.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/bmx-bike-small_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="A picture of a BMX bike" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/bmx-bike-small_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>
</figure>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>Anecdote! </em><em>When I was 11 years old all I wanted for Christmas was a BMX bike.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>It was strongly implied by my campaign that the future lacking a BMX bike would not be a pleasant one to anyone. So I got one. The next day I took it out for a spin (yes, in the snow) and immediately encountered my neighbourhood nemesis riding a similar, but more expensive brand-new bike.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>I was devastated. After 27 years I have still not entirely forgiven the universe this betrayal. I had received a great benefit, but my rival had it better, rendering mine absolutely worthless.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Sensible adults, however, are capable of shrugging off such setbacks quickly. Yet a lot of effort is expended by companies to make sure nobody gets upset about anything. This fear of disappointments often cripples efforts to gain significant improvements.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>We can’t try this, as someone might not like it. You can’t do that, as someone may consider it unfair. </em>It’s a familiar song.</p>

<p dir="ltr">So it’s easy to end up playing it safe, getting better coffee, handing out freebies to the employees. The ambition is misdirected and the company keeps investing an increasing amount of energy in trying to come up with new perks that do not offend anyone, and sound better than what the competitors have.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Here’s an amusing quote from a <a href="http://fortune.com/best-companies/google-alphabet-1/">recent article by Fortune</a>:</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>The company culture truly makes workers feel they're valued and respected as a human being, not as a cog in a machine. The perks are phenomenal. From three prepared organic meals a day to unlimited snacks, artisan coffee and tea to free personal-fitness classes, health clinics, on-site oil changes, haircuts, spa truck, bike-repair truck, nap pods, free on-site laundry rooms, and subsidized wash and fold. The list is endless.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">No mistake, quality coffee and free movie tickets are <em>sweet</em>, but they do not form a viable long-term tactic to manage the happiness decay of ambitious people. Nor do the haircuts, bike-repairs, or… what the hell is a spa truck? I bet it doesn’t help either, though now I kind of want one for Futurice.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Having my employer shower me with services and gifts gives me a quaint satisfaction of being royalty, of being special. But it is a fleeting feeling. Nothing suffices, you get used to all the perks and start to take them for granted.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>Speculation and some hyperbole!</em></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left:80px"><em>Are the real royalty or the super rich ever really satisfied with anything, I wonder? Muhammad Mahabat Khan, the Nawab of Junagadh, arranged a grand wedding celebration of his favourite pet dog Roshanara with a golden retriever Bobby. His people were starving. He invited 50000 guests. After the ceremonies, did he kick back and feel complete? No, he acquired 500 more dogs and spent 11% of the entire state’s income to cater for them.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">There are tools that claim to help you achieve tranquil inner peace. Self-help books on life acceptance. Endless articles in the web: <em>“3 ways to be happy”, “7 ways to be happier”, “The 25 habits of the punchably happy people”</em>. Mindfulness is trending. Some people still advocate psychedelic drugs or religion. I don’t know what Bob Ross’s secret was, but it seemed to be working for him. Maybe he had a spa truck?</p>

<p dir="ltr">I haven’t really tried any of these and I remain sceptical.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There is, however, something else that a company can do. We can help the employees to advance a good cause, such as open source, technology, science, education, social equality, or sustainability.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If the employee can have the time and company support to pursue something that brings out her passion, it will do a lot more than a crazy variety of perks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The "help the employees"-part of the statement above is <em>very important</em>. People have causes they want to advance. The company can and should support them in that, if the cause is good.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The traditional corporate social responsibility approach has the company deciding and declaring the cause and then just throw some money at it. That may help with PR, but it’s not going to help with keeping the people happy and motivated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">How do you assess if the cause is good? We use a simple rule. The activities we sponsor must benefit the persons doing them, the company, and the society. Open source is an obvious example, and I <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/year-2015-in-company-sponsored-open-source">wrote about the benefits earlier</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">People get acclimated to whatever level of luxury they get, but you never get tired of having more purpose or meaning in your life. That is why employers should support their people in doing good. Every party benefits and our world is saved in the process.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I'll be happy to discuss anything related, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/hippielobster">catch me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Digital technogy is awesome! It makes the impossible possible. I remember being one of the lucky ones who got a mobile phone in the early 90’s. Could there be a more wondrous device? And emails? I came to work after maternity leave and it was there! What a difference! The speed, reach and simultaneity of it! Not to mention text messaging! The world had changed. We had stepped into the world of communication. It’s a world in which we are – as companies – still struggling to find our way.</p>

<p>After the early advances in companies, digital has changed our behavior in our personal lives and in our homes faster and more profoundly than in our working environment. We expect more from the digital services we use in our personal lives than the ones we use at work.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">A digital gulf</h3>

<p>There is a digital separation. How on earth did this separation come around? What we take for granted at home and expect from the services we personally use doesn’t follow us to work. We go to our workplaces in traditional companies ready to fight every reform with familiar arguments:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“Not in our business…”</li>
	<li>“Our customers don’t want to…”</li>
	<li>“Our business is different…”</li>
</ul>

<p>What we expect from other companies’ services, doesn’t apply to us:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“There are legal obstacles…”</li>
	<li>“Our IT systems are too complicated…”</li>
	<li>“Personal service will always be the only relevant touch point in our business…”</li>
</ul>

<p>Company leaders nod at digitalization and accept its winning streak as a fact. They include it in their strategy, but – at worst – they boast about not being on any of the social media channels themselves. They feel they’re above it, even though that’s where their customers are. Why did the development of digital services become such a pain in the ass? An anxious MUST? The simple answer is that companies do not possess the capabilities and tools necessary to lead and organize digital business. Business leaders try to stuff the digital in the frames of their old business. They are stuck in the procedures from production economics but digital business is born in the era of customer economics.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Pitfalls to avoid</h3>

<p>In my experience, these are some of the mistakes to avoid when organizing the digital. It’ll help some of the much-needed joy in development:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<em>Do not hand responsibility for a digital project to the wrong person.</em> Any digital project leader, project manager, expert or team has to believe in what is being done. If they are not passionately enthusiastic about it, they’ll see nothing but obstacles. The barriers and hindrances will come up during the project no matter what, so problems are not a good place to start. Spreading digital doesn’t happen along traditional lines. Maintenance managers and organizations are not the best environments for implementing new services and ways of working.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Enable success.</strong><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<em>Do not mix two different issues: creating new digital services for customers and automating old legacy systems.</em> It just doesn’t work. The UX/customer interface people and traditional IT people march to the beat of different drums. Start developing digital services from the customer's point of view and proceed from there. You can always find competent help to solve technological issues. Don’t work on legacy terms. It’ll just make you slow and cranky. Trial and error and analyze and learn and trial …<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Enable progress.</strong><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<em>Don't be democratic.</em> In a traditional company most of your management team is… well, traditional. Voting doesn’t produce the right decisions. Your CDO or whoever has the abilities and enthusiasm to take that responsibility should have more votes. And don’t leave your CDO, or person filling a similar niche, to fight the battle alone.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Enable innovative decisions.</strong><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<em>Don't forget to develop your brand and culture accordingly.</em> How will digitalization affect your identity, how should it manifest itself in your culture? Take small measures in your everyday work in the organization. The best way to learn is to do it yourself – in a relevant way. Provide digital pioneers and the rest of the organization opportunities for continuous interaction. Build curiosity into your culture. That way understanding grows and insights multiply. Communicate, communicate, communicate.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Enable curiosity that breaks barriers. </strong><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<em>Do not measure the wrong things.</em> Measure the effects you want to have an impact on. Assign relevant indicators for success and failure. Why did you start the project? Why is it a part of your strategy? Don’t let the organization valuate progress, each and everyone using their own metrics.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Enable focus.</strong><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<em>Do not believe for a second that digitalization is going to proceed smoothly by itself after it has been organized.</em> It won’t. New endeavors need continuous attention and care. Otherwise they wither under the weight of the dominant traditional thinking.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>​Enable long-term change.</strong>
</li>
</ol>

<p>We should make digitalization today’s voyage of discovery. A lot of curiosity, barrier-free thinking, agile planning, use of scouting, oodles of common sense and a touch of craziness.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>On Roberto Verganti's Four-Step Process of Innovation Incubation</em></p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/blog-photo-questionmarks--neznh5xw93_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/blog-photo-questionmarks--neznh5xw93_s600x0_q85_noupscale.jpg"></a></div>

<p>"The more ideas, the better" has been conventional wisdom in innovation theory and consulting, as well as in design thinking. In the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/the-innovative-power-of-criticism">January issue of Harvard Business Review</a>, Professor <strong>Roberto Verganti</strong> from Politecnico di Milano, wrote a controversial commentary on the role of criticism in the early stages of innovation process.</p>

<p>Verganti argues that any development process aimed at great innovativeness should <em>place focus more on developing ideas within a small circle of people</em>. He proposes a four step process that should facilitate innovation through carefully applied criticism. It consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Individual reflection</li>
	<li>Sparring partners</li>
	<li>Radical circles</li>
	<li>Outsiders</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me describe how I interpret these actions.</p>

<h3>1. Individual reflection</h3>

<p>Verganti's proposal for reflection is best understood through an example. Introducing a case study of <a href="http://en.voxfurniture.com/?locale=en">Vox</a>, a polish furniture company, he describes a creative process spanning several weeks among a team of 19 company members. During this time, the participants were encouraged to explore their own ideas and build them independently. Another important aspect was that the participant were encouraged to trust their own feelings and reflection as the source of feedback. Instead of relying on user or customer insights, people were to draw on their own experiences.</p>

<p>I fully endorse individual reflection. Much of the bad publicity for "Brainstorming" and other forms of ideation comes from poorly organized and facilitated group work. It's important to acknowledge that much idea generation work can and should be done individually. Lack of time is often an issue, too. Although scientific evidence for the influence of incubation is incoherent, it does agree on the usefulness of taking time and having breaks in between your creative work sprints.</p>

<h3>2. Sparring partners</h3>

<p>Constructive feedback develops ideas and the thinking behind them. The best way to get in the constructive mood is to get the feedback from trusted peers. Trust is extremely important to keep the recipient attuned to the feedback, to make them feel that the talk is about the idea and the criticism has not nothing to do with the person. This is not easy and requires trust in the feedback provider's good intents and professionalism. At this point, it should be clear</p>

<p>Giving and receiving crits in a professional setting means that <strong>criticism is distinct from skepticism</strong>. Criticism should be a tool to challenge assumptions and propositions about an idea so that ideas can be developed further. It should not be confused with skepticism, which is a prevailing negative attitude towards an idea. Verganti firmly believes that applied this way, criticism can become an engine of innovation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>criticism can become an engine of innovation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Verganti lists numerous times in the hi-tech industry in which two great minds have together been responsible for developing groundbreaking innovations - Microsoft, Apple, and Google are all good examples. A practical challenge may be finding the right person to work with. Here Verganti proposes "<em>a pitching session meets speed dating</em>" arrangement for introducing people and ideas so attendees with similar ideas should find one another.</p>

<h3>3. Radical circles</h3>

<p>Verganti calls a group 10-20 people involved in a shared creative effort a <strong>radical circle</strong>. He proposes that after the ideas have gone through individual and peer processing, they should be brought to an assembly of everyone involved for the next round of criticism. Here, criticism should be presented at a workshop that actively improves the presented ideas as well as seeks to connect and combine these to reach new levels of innovativeness.</p>

<p>Everyone who's ever participated in anything resembling what's proposed above will know the challenges of destroying and recombining ideas people have cherished and championed for some time. To find a common ground, Verganti proposes to seek mutual understanding for "no-go" zones, common enemies or directions nobody has found desirable. By working through these areas of avoidance that constrain the design space, group may eventually converge on some shared understanding on what their greatest ideas and most hopeful directions are.</p>

<p>Verganti gives one interesting example of such design-by-committee success story. The Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe was developed by a radical circle. This circle came up with two ideas that they successfully merged: Lonely Planet guide for driving and responsive vehicles for passionate drivers. The outcome was a success.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

</figure>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">4. Outsiders</h2>

<p>The final stage in Verganti's process is external evaluation. These outsiders (also called interpreters by Verganti) should preferably be from domains distant to the product at hand, so they can feed in new kinds of ideas on how to best progress with the creative work. The logic is that distinguished professionals from other areas may see and perceive things invisible for the radical circle. As an example, Verganti describes the aforementioned Alfa Romeo case. The outsiders involved in that project included "<em>a maker of leather goods, the CEO of a high-end resort, a manufacturer of fitness equipment, and a theater director</em>."</p>

<p>Verganti resists to mention anything about users or consumers in this stage either even though this group might have something valuable to say as well as we all proponents of human-centered design believe.</p>

<h2>My thoughts on Verganti's Four Step Process</h2>

<p>Should we trust Verganti on this? During my scientific career, I've had many heated and sometimes fruitful discussions about validating design and innovation methods. I see that Verganti is clearly pointing out a valuable, often neglected aspect of the creative process - proper criticism. This is healthy, as long as it prevents us from not getting too dogmatic about the approaches we adopt in our design (design as in design thinking) work. In this case, suspending criticism for too long is not healthy.  I believe you must be critical within the creative process, just be considerate with it! But I also fear Verganti's methodology is also falling a victim of its own design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can be critical within the creative process, just be considerate with it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm personally skeptical about the self-referential design component, prominently present in the first step. I agree that it may lead to more outlandish ideas, it may be also be a great waste of time. Without exposing your ideas to other people, you may be captivated by your own specific circumstances and have difficulties seeing the forest from the trees. While you can expect professionals to provide a constructive comments in response to your ideas, presenting prospective users and customers will also give some real-world "criticism" which you just can't ignore. Verganti could name this fifth step "5. Touch reality."</p>

<p>I can't attribute much of the success of his cited cases to the proposed methodology. Creative processes - design processes - are subjects to many factors. Case studies, even the best ones, are unfortunately totally unsuitable to proof any solution of the format "<em>do this, don't do that</em>" as they can only serve to falsify certain approaches.</p>

<p>But I will cite one additional supporting "case." <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/295069/heres-first-group-picture-apples-new-industrial-design-team/" target="_blank">Apple's industrial design team</a> is in size and behavior very much alike the radical circle discussed by Verganti. They are approximately 20 people who tediously and continuously crunch through ideas together. Everyone criticizes and brings into play their best understanding of people, technology and business (read more on their habits from <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/303396/design-studio-behind-iron-curtain/" target="_blank">CultOfMac article</a>).The results are provoking and give credence to one particular feature of Verganti's method.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, make sure to check out <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/a-saner-windows-command-line-part-1">Part 1</a> of this series first--it'll introduce you to some improvements to the basic Windows command line experience that we'll be building on in this post.</p>

<p>Today, I'm going to be introducing some resources that'll allow us to improve our Git experience, and some utilities that'll allow us to completely overhaul the console experience altogether.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Git Gud</h2>

<p>For those not aware, Git is a popular version control system, in the same vein as SVN, TFS, or Mercurial. While it has GUI clients, the official release is a CLI-only tool, and advanced techniques are often difficult to accomplish in existing GUI clients.</p>

<p>If you don't already have a Git install you're happy with, let's go get one for you. Fire up your newly souped-up PowerShell client, and let's make Chocolatey work for us. <code>choco list git</code> will give us way too many results, but if we just do a <code>choco install git</code> it'll give us what we're after.</p>

<p>I'd also like to point out a nice feature of Chocolatey that I ran into while preparing for this post--I was trying to uninstall Git so I could do a fresh install, and got the following error:</p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">choco uninstall git
Uninstalling the following packages:
git
git not uninstalled. An error occurred during uninstall:
 Unable to uninstall 'git 2.7.4' because 'poshgit 0.6.0.20160310' depends on it.

Chocolatey uninstalled 0/1 packages. 1 packages failed.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).
Failures
 - git</code></pre>

<p>It detected that I had another package that depended on Git, and refused to allow it. If necessary, you can force uninstall of a package, but it's nice to have that safeguard.</p>

<p>Anyway, after Chocolatey finishes installing Git, it'll tell you that it added Git to your PATH, and that you should restart your shell, so let's follow its advice. Once we're back up and running, it's time to make using Git from PowerShell much easier with...</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">posh-git</h3>

<p>Note that that's not posh as in "fancy and upper-class", but rather short for <strong>Po</strong>wer<strong>Sh</strong>ell...though given the improvements it makes, I guess you could call it posh. posh-git adds tab completion for git commands, and modifies your prompt when you're in a folder that contains a git repository, like so:<br>
 </p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/posh-git--rj80o58pmn_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="posh-git image" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/posh-git--rj80o58pmn_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>
</figure>

<p>posh-git is telling me that I'm currently on the master branch and the triple-equals indicates that I'm up to date with that branch. The green text indicates files that are staged for commit, and that I've added 0 new files, changed 1 file, and deleted zero files. The red text indicates files that are <em>not</em> staged for commit, and that, of those files, I've added 0 new files, changed 1 file, and deleted zero files.</p>

<p>The exact formatting and coloring of the prompt are user-customizable, but the defaults have always worked just fine for me.</p>

<p>Let's go grab it from the Chocolatey gallery!</p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="bash">choco install poshgit</code></pre>

<p>You might need to restart PowerShell after installation, but other than that, it should Just Work™ . Entering a directory with a git repository should change your prompt. If you have an SSH key, posh-git will attempt to find it on PowerShell startup, and ask you for your passkey. This will allow you to do <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> using SSH, which is nicer than doing so via HTTPS, because you don't need to authenticate with a username and password every time.</p>

<p>If you find that it's not working, you may need to modify your PowerShell profile. You can find its location by typing <code>$profile</code> in a PowerShell prompt. If you try to navigate to that location and find that it doesn't exist, you can just create it yourself. By default, posh-git adds the following block to your profile. If posh-git's not working, and the block isn't there, you can just add it yourself:<br>
 </p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang=""># Load posh-git example profile
if(Test-Path Function:\Prompt) {Rename-Item Function:\Prompt PrePoshGitPrompt -Force}
. 'C:\tools\poshgit\dahlbyk-posh-git-1941da2\profile.example.ps1'
Rename-Item Function:\Prompt PoshGitPrompt -Force
function Prompt() {
	if(Test-Path Function:\PrePoshGitPrompt){
		++$global:poshScope; 
		New-Item function:\script:Write-host -value "param([object] `$object, `$backgroundColor, `$foregroundColor, [switch] `$nonewline) " -Force  | 
			Out-Null;$private:p = PrePoshGitPrompt; 
		if(--$global:poshScope -eq 0) {
			Remove-Item function:\Write-Host -Force
		}
	}
	PoshGitPrompt
}</code></pre>

<p>You may need to modify the <code>. 'C:\tools\poshgit\dahlbyk-posh-git-1941da2\profile.example.ps1'</code> path if that's not representative of where your posh-git is installed.</p>

<p>My favorite feature of posh-git is probably the way its tab-completion interacts with PSReadLine's Ctrl + Space autocompletion. If you type <code>git</code>, and then press Ctrl + Space, you get a list of possible git commands.<br>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Leveling Up</h2>

<p>In the previous post, I mentioned that we'd be extending some goodness of the Windows 10 console to non-Windows 10 machines. It's time we talked about how we'll be doing that. Our secret here today is replacing our default consoles with wrapper applications, sometimes called terminal emulators or console emulators.</p>

<p>There are several options, all with their own pros, cons and idiosyncrasies. Among the most popular are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://conemu.github.io/">ConEmu</a></li>
	<li>
<a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder</a>, a fork of ConEmu with a different color scheme and a focus on portability.</li>
	<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">Console2</a></li>
	<li>
<a href="https://github.com/cbucher/console">ConsoleZ</a>, a fork of Console2 updated for better rendering on Windows Vista and above, and with many more options.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them give you tabs, the ability to host multiple different shells in a single window and better editing and selection at the <em>very</em> least.</p>

<p>ConEmu, Cmder and ConsoleZ are all active projects with frequent updates. In the interest of keeping this post focused, I'm only going to be talking about the one I have the most experience with: ConEmu. There are <a href="http://devtidbits.com/2014/05/21/create-a-better-windows-command-line-prompt/">plenty of</a> <a href="https://aarontgrogg.com/blog/2015/07/31/a-better-windows-command-line-experience-comparing-powercmd-vs-console2-vs-consolez-vs-conemu-vs-cmder/#tldr">other</a> <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/tsneed/cmder-making-the-command-line-your-best-friend">posts</a> on the internet that discuss the alternatives, and you should feel free to make your own choice.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">ConEmu</h3>

<p>Here's what my ConEmu looks like on startup.<br>
 </p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/default_conemu_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="ConEmu start image" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/default_conemu_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Hello, world!</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here's what it looks like when I'm in the middle of doing some git-wrangling for a little experimental project.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/conemu_wranglin_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Fancy conemu image" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/conemu_wranglin_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Okay, so it's not exactly rocket-science-git.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Yep, that's an instance of <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> hosted in ConEmu in a split tab.</p>

<p>Right out of the box, ConEmu comes with a number of preset shells already set up. When I installed it, it knew how to open PowerShell, cmd.exe, git bash, and adding more is remarkably simple.</p>

<p>If you're convinced, then let's go get ConEmu, again using Chocolatey.</p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">choco install conemu</code></pre>

<p>Cmder and ConsoleZ also have packages on Chocolatey, so if those are more your style, you can feel free to grab them instead.</p>

<p>Once ConEmu is installed, close out of your PowerShell window, and fire up your shiny new ConEmu install. You've probably got a little bit of configuring to do before it's comfortable, and I have some recommendations.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Hotkeys</h4>

<p>Make your way to <em>Settings -&gt; Keys &amp; Macro</em>, and change the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Create new console or new window (check 'Multiple in one ConEmu window')" from its default to Ctrl + T.</li>
	<li>"Close current tab: Close(6)" from its default to Ctrl + F4.</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer those settings, because they mimic browser behavior, which is the only other place I use a lot of tabs.</p>

<p>You should also skim through the other hotkeys while you're in here. A lot of shortcuts use the "Apps" key, a seldom-used key that usually lives between Right-Alt and Right-Ctrl, but is missing from quite a few keyboard layouts, especially on laptops. If you see anything using the Apps key that looks useful to you, consider rebinding it to something more accessible.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Selection</h4>

<p>This one is only for the Windows 10 folks. I actually like Windows 10's keyboard-selection better than ConEmu's, because it only allows selection of the current command buffer. ConEmu's keyboard-based selection allows selection of the current command buffer, the prompt, and everything above it.</p>

<p>To disable ConEmu's keyboard-selection, make your way to: <em>Settings -&gt; Keys &amp; Macro -&gt; Mark/Copy</em>. Once there, look to the bottom of the panel, and disable the <strong>Start selection with Shift+Arrow (Text = Left/Right/Home/End, Block = Up/Down)</strong> option.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once you've got everything set up the way you like it, take it for a test run. ConEmu alone has more options than I've personally experimented with, so I certainly can't discuss them all in a single blog post! And if you're curious, the command that I used to create a new split tab with Notepad++ was <code>notepad++ -new_console:s</code>. You can find more details on the <code>-new_console</code> syntax (and a whole more) in <a href="http://conemu.github.io/en/NewConsole.html">ConEmu's documentation for creating a new console</a>. I should also note that notepad++ is in my PATH, so I didn't need to give the shell the entire canonical path to its .exe.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">In Closing</h2>

<p>If you've followed this series from start to finish, you may have gone from something like this:</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Boooo!</span></figcaption>

<p>To something like this:</p>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Yaaaay!</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And even if your own console's transformation wasn't quite as dramatic, I hope I was able to introduce you to some new tools, like Chocolatey and PackageManagement!</p>

      <title>Spicing Up a Music Event</title>
      <description>How the Spice Program brought up-to-date contest schedules into the hands of music lovers in Helsinki.</description>

<p>As the red-white A320 descends towards Helsinki-Vantaa Airport on the 12th of March, a familiar view unfolds beneath my window. Having both work and family ties to the Finnish capital, I am no stranger to this flight route, and yet the sight of Helsinki excites me more than usually. For the first time since 2006, my old love <em>“Jugend musiziert”</em> is back in town, with around 200 international guests and a whopping seven days of music at five different venues.</p>

<p>The event, commonly known as <em>Jumu</em> among insiders, is an annual music competition for children and teenagers that’s almost as old as my parents’ generation, taking place all over Germany and at selected German schools abroad. As a young pupil at Helsinki German School, I first took the stage as a participant in 2000, then moved behind it six years later to join the organizing team. As participant numbers grew, we had to come up with new ways of storing and syncing information, and so I took my first steps in software development while designing and building a digital signup form, which gradually evolved into a full-fledged CMS and reporting system (and, incidentally, helped land me my first full-time job).</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/img_0359_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/img_0359_s600x0_q85_noupscale.jpg"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">The German School, awaiting its international guests</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This year <em>Jumu</em> celebrates its 20th birthday in the region of Northern &amp; Eastern Europe, which Helsinki belongs to, and so in mid-February I decided to build a little present. Even better, I would open-source it under the <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/">Spice Program</a> to combine code wizardry with art and education, both topics that the program is expanding towards. Given the time constraints, I focused on the most important feature for participants, audiences and organizers alike: <em>Who is performing when, where and what?</em></p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Building an iOS app</h2>

<p>Being an expert in iOS development, I started with the most familiar platform and was soon surprised how much can be achieved in little time when one is equipped with domain knowledge and in control of the mobile API. There were a few hiccups related to developers’ favorites such as localization and <a href="https://vimeo.com/151374026">time zones</a>, but overall the journey was smooth and after 36 hours of work spread across three weeks, I submitted the app to Apple’s reviewers. It was <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/tr/app/jugend-musiziert-nord-und/id1088620132">accepted</a> five days later, a week before my flight to Helsinki.</p>

<p>Having the iOS app ready felt great, but also incomplete. Surely there would be plenty of Android users, especially among the participants? My Android experience was limited to a single project many years ago and Java isn’t exactly fun either, but there was that new kid on the block that <a href="http://twitter.com/andrestaltz">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jevakallio">colleagues</a> (and other <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/560511204867575808">famous people</a>) couldn’t stop talking about: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>. I had shied away from it earlier because of JavaScript’s hackiness, but with one week left, a little bit of hackiness was exactly what I needed…</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Porting the app to Android</h2>

<p>Developing with React Native was a wholly different experience. Some things were trickier: Instead of getting friendly advice from the Swift compiler, I often found myself debugging JS syntax through the not-so-friendly red screen in the emulator. Then again, being able to reload the app like a website is a huge time-saver, and the wealth of third-party libraries available for React Native is impressive. After some searching, I even found a somewhat decent replacement for iOS’s native UISegmentedControl, which I use to switch between days and venues.</p>

<p>On the day before all the guests arrived, I finally had something potentially shippable on my emulator. But sending it off before ever trying it on a real device felt a bit too badass, and I couldn’t get the signing to work either. Luckily the German School is just one block away from the Futurice office, and with my colleague Andre’s help, the app went <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jugendmusiziert.jumunordost">live</a> a few hours later! The required effort was 13 hours from setup to store submission.</p>

<p>Later that week, I took a break from the hustle and bustle of the organizing team and came over to the office again for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBLXGSyF3lo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1365">interview at Futurice’s wwweeklies</a>. Check it out if you want to hear the full story!</p>

<p>Here are the codebases for <a href="https://github.com/richeterre/jumu-nordost-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/richeterre/jumu-nordost-react-native">Android</a>.</p>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">The iOS app in action</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">What's next?</h2>

<p>Now that the dust has settled, I’ll try to find some time to focus on the biggest selling point of React Native, which is supporting both Android and iOS natively from the same codebase with only the most platform-specific elements kept apart. It will be interesting to see how much effort it takes to add iOS support to my current React Native codebase, using the native app as a benchmark. If it works as advertised, it would mean saving precious time for adding the features that music lovers want and need.</p>

      <title>Categorizing software from rigid to emergent</title>
      <description>Some people believe that computers are constrained to only do what they were programmed to do. This is true only for the simplest programs. More advanced programs can also seek out new behavior that is not explicitly encoded in their source code. Complex behavior can emerge from simple rules. Let's see some examples starting from the most rigid programs and ending up in programs that are more than collections of rules.

        <![CDATA[<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Some people believe that computers are constrained to only do what they were programmed to do. This is true only for the simplest programs. More advanced programs can also seek out new behavior that is not explicitly encoded in their source code. Complex behavior can emerge from simple rules. Let's see some examples starting from the most rigid programs and ending up in programs that are more than collections of rules.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Software engineering</h2>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Traditional software engineering solves problems by dividing them continuously into smaller and smaller steps until the steps are concrete enough to be expressed as program code. For example, a video player decompresses a video stream, extracts frames and displays them on a screen. Each of these stages consists of even smaller steps. There are certainly a lot of steps involved, but it is relatively clear what each step must do and how they are to be combined. Most software development is like this.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Machine learning</h2>

<p class="article__paragraph">Some problems are, however, too complicated to yield to the traditional engineering approach. Examples include tasks such as recognizing objects in images or teaching a computer to play Go better than human champions.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Object recognition is difficult because the task doesn't decompose cleanly into simpler subtasks. A sensible sounding strategy would be to start by trying to detect elementary shapes in an image, but it is not clear what kind of shapes are helpful in describing objects. Moreover, even if one could decide what shapes to look for, combining detected shapes into an object description is a difficult task in itself. A round shape in a picture could be either a bicycle wheel or a pizza. The context is needed to determine the correct interpretation. If the surroundings in the picture contain shapes related to a typical street view, the round object might be a bicycle wheel; if the picture contains shapes related to a dinner table, the round shape is more likely to be a pizza. The correct interpretation of shapes depends on how other shapes are interpreted. This makes the recognition very complicated.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Tasks that do not decompose naturally are difficult to solve on a computer. Even if something is instinctively easy for humans, like object recognition, formalizing it as code can be infeasible. The standard way of modeling things by decomposing them into a hierarchy of smaller pieces is not possible if the hierarchy is too deep or if there are too many interdependencies within and across the hierarchy levels.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Complex problems like object recognition are usually attacked from an angle that differs from traditional software engineering. A computer is given plenty of example pictures of the objects it should learn to recognize. It will then search through possible algorithms that map an image into an object label. The intention is to find the algorithm that gives the most accurate results on the provided examples. This approach is called machine learning (or more exactly, supervised machine learning). It has seen a massive uptake in recent years in problems that are otherwise too complex to solve.<br>
<br>
Machine learning is similar to traditional software engineering in the sense that they are both trying to solve a specific task. They differ in how a solution is found. The traditional approach relies on an engineer's ability to formulate a solution on a programming language. The machine learning approach depends on a computer to search for an algorithm that performs well on data. Machine learning is more flexible because it can find solutions even when only the goal is specified, but enumerating rules for every possible situation is infeasible.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Self-organization</h2>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Could we have even more flexible programs by abandoning the requirement to specify a goal? Surprisingly, removing the goal still leads to something interesting. Some systems exhibit self-organization where no one sets overall goals yet meaningful patterns emerge spontaneously.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Software ecosystems are examples of self-organization. Millions of developers are constantly trying out new ideas. Most of the applications will go unnoticed but some will gain popularity. Popular ideas will get copied and combined with other popular ideas. This merging of ideas drives the whole software ecosystem into new directions.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Self-organization in software is our best lead so far towards general artificial intelligence and computational creativity. Traditional software engineering and machine learning are too narrowly focused on solving one task at a time. An artificial intelligence must not only be good at playing Go or at recognizing objects but it has to be good at adapting to new situations (that's what intelligence means). This kind of genuine adaptivity can't come from processes that optimize only for specific goals. Self-organization is currently an academic research topic and no practical applications exist yet.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Summary</h2>

<p class="article__paragraph">The table below summarizes the different levels of flexibility in software.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While most current software fits in the stereotypical view of programs as collections of rules that define what to do in each situation, software is by no means limited to such rigidity. Flexible computational models bring us programs that play complex games, recognize objects and, in the future, perhaps even lead to an artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><!--StartFragment-->I know what you're probably thinking. One of the reasons you use Windows is so you don't <em>have</em> to use the command line. But sometimes it's unavoidable—maybe you need to do some advanced git-wrangling, or you're developing in an environment with CLI-based tools that are far more mature than their GUI counterparts. But it doesn't have to be painful. With a little bit of tweaking, it can even be—dare I say?—more pleasant than a GUI-based experience. <!--EndFragment--></p>

<p><!--StartFragment-->A word of warning: most of the advice that follows only applies to Windows 7 SP1 and up. Proceed at your own risk if you're running anything earlier.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">The Basics</h2>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Let's be honest. What many people think of as "the default Windows command line", cmd.exe, is atrociously bad. Selection is awkward, resizing is hard, the syntax is arcane, the list goes on. If you do nothing else, there are two things you can do to make the basic, vanilla experience bearable.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Use PowerShell</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Banish cmd.exe from your shortcuts, and upgrade to its successor, PowerShell. It includes a <em>vast</em> array of built in commands (known as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714395%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)">Cmdlets</a>) and scripts that support piping between each other, allowing you to compose actions from simple building blocks. If there's ever anything you're missing from the old cmd, you can always invoke cmd.exe from PowerShell. There's also tons of community support, so if there's something missing out of the box, odds are that somebody has filled that gap already.<br>
<br>
And, purely subjectively, I think the .ps1 syntax is a <em>lot</em> more readable than the old .bat syntax.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Verbose, but at least you don't need a decoder ring.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p> </p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Upgrade to Windows 10</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->I know that this one will be a harder pill to swallow (and is likely impossible in some enterprise scenarios) but the benefits really can't be overstated. 'conhost.exe', Windows' basic console window host that underlies both cmd and PowerShell has seen some pretty substantial improvements. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt427362.aspx">This MSDN article</a> lays out the details, but the high points are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drag-to-resize</li>
	<li>Automatic text reflowing on resize</li>
	<li>Ctrl + X/C/V support for cut/copy/paste</li>
	<li>Selection that does line-wrapping</li>
	<li>Transparency</li>
	<li>A full-screen mode<!--EndFragment-->
</li>
</ul>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Already on Windows 10? You can enable these features by just right-clicking the console's title bar and going to Properties. Once there, you'll want to enable the following in the <strong>Options</strong> tab:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enable Ctrl key shortcuts</li>
	<li>Filter clipboard contents on paste</li>
	<li>Enable line wrapping selection</li>
	<li>Extended text selection keys</li>
</ul>

<p>then, in the <strong>Layout </strong>tab:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrap text output on resize
	<figure class="article__figure">

	<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Like so.</span></figcaption>
	</figure>
	<!--EndFragment-->
</li>
</ul>

<p><!--StartFragment-->In addition, Windows 10 also bundles <a href="https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine">PsReadLine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OneGet/oneget">OneGet</a> (though it calls it PackageManagement), which make the PowerShell experience leaps and bounds better.<br>
PSReadLine gives you a lot of syntax and autocompletion goodies, and I'll be going into more detail about PackageManagement in a little bit.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Just those two changes will make your command line experience significantly more palatable...but we can go further.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">
<!--StartFragment-->Improving Usability<!--EndFragment-->
</h2>

<p><!--StartFragment-->First, lets take care of anybody who can't upgrade to Windows 10—you can still get a lot of the goodness that follows. You'll need to do two things to catch up to the Windows 10 default experience. If you're already on Windows 10, you can skip to to the "Package Management" section.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">
<!--StartFragment-->Install WMF 5.0<!--EndFragment-->
</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment--><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395">Windows Management Framework 5.0</a> will give you OneGet/PackageManagement (which I'll be talking about soon, I swear), and enables easy installation of modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">PowerShell Gallery</a>. We need that second piece because next, we're going to...<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">
<!--StartFragment-->Install PsReadLine<!--EndFragment-->
</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment--><a href="https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine">PsReadLine</a> gives you syntax highlighting, context-sensitive autocompletion via Ctrl + Space, supercharged tab-completion and a whole lot more. The project's Github page has more information, and links to articles of deep dives into it, so check those out if you're curious. To install it, just make sure that WMF 5.0 is installed, open a PowerShell prompt, and enter: </p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">Install-Module PSReadline</code></pre>

<p>Voila!<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Package Management</h2>

<p><!--StartFragment-->This is where it starts getting good. If you've ever used Debian or any of its derivatives, you've probably been a little jealous of apt-get. Well, Windows (finally!) has an answer to that in the form of the PackageManagement module. The project itself is open source, and goes by the name of <a href="https://github.com/OneGet/oneget">OneGet</a>.<br>
<br>
Why don't we try it out? Let's go get the <a href="https://pscx.codeplex.com/">Powershell Community Extensions</a> from the PowerShell Gallery. I happen to know that the name of the package I'm after is "PSCX", so:<!--EndFragment--></p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">Install-Package Pscx</code></pre>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Easy.<br>
<br>
PackageManagement is actually more of a "Package Manager Manager"—it doesn't provide packages itself, but provides a common interface to other package providers. By default, PackageManagement only has one provider: PowerShellGet, which uses the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">PowerShell Gallery</a> as its source. In fact, if you installed PsReadLine earlier, you were using PowerShellGet directly with that 'Install-Module' call!<br>
That's pretty neat, but fairly limited in scope. We want a provider that points toward a more general software repository. Fortunately, just such a thing exists, in the form of <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>!<br>
<br>
At this point, we have two options—we can install Chocolatey manually, or we can do it through PackageManagement. Unfortunately, the Chocolatey provider for PackageManagement isn't ready for prime time just yet. It <em>works</em>, but it's out of date compared to the standalone Chocolatey client, and isn't recommended. The Chocolatey team hopes to have the PackageManagement provider ready some time this year, but for now, head over to <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey.org</a> and follow their instructions to get the standalone client installed.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Chocolatey</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->In Part 2 of this series, we're going to be leaning on Chocolatey pretty heavily to improve our Git experience, but for now, let's just take it for a test drive.<br>
<br>
You can invoke it with 'chocolatey', but brevity is nice, and it responds to 'choco' as well.<br>
Now, I always find myself needing a simple, lightweight image editor with a bit more power than Paint. I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint.NET</a>, so why don't we see if we can get it from chocolatey?</p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">C:\Users\mcali&gt; choco list paint.net
jivkok.dev1 1.1.0.8
kellyelton.devenvironment 1.0.0.11
paint.net 4.0.6
Pinta 1.5.0.20130501
4 packages found.</code></pre>

<p>Yep, there it is!</p>

<p>'choco list' <!--StartFragment-->does a search of the chocolatey gallery, with an optional search term. You can also ask it to show you locally-installed packages with the '--local-only' or '-l' flag. For example, my work laptop lists the following for locally-installed packages:<!--EndFragment--></p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">C:\Users\neilm&gt; choco list -l
chocolatey 0.9.9.12
ConEmu 16.3.13.0
DotNet4.5.1 4.5.1.20140606
git 2.7.4
git.install 2.7.4
notepadplusplus 6.9
notepadplusplus.install 6.9
poshgit 0.6.0.20160310
rust 1.7.0
VisualStudioCode 0.10.11
10 packages installed.</code></pre>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Let's get Paint.NET installed, and see if chocolatey delivers on its promise.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">C:\Users\mcali&gt; choco install paint.net
Installing the following packages:
paint.net
By installing you accept licenses for the packages.

&lt;info-log snipped for brevity&gt;

Chocolatey installed 1/1 package(s). 0 package(s) failed.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).</code></pre>

<p><!--StartFragment-->In Paint.NET's case, chocolatey just fires up the .exe installer in silent mode, which then takes over.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/install_pdn_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Installing Paint.NET screenshot" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/install_pdn_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Look Ma, no Googling!</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But actually, maybe I've had a change of heart. I don't need an image editor after all. Let's uninstall it:<!--EndFragment--></p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">C:\Users\mcali&gt; choco uninstall paint.net
Uninstalling the following packages:
paint.net

paint.net v4.0.6
 Skipping auto uninstaller - AutoUninstaller feature is not enabled.
 paint.net has been successfully uninstalled.

Chocolatey uninstalled 1/1 packages. 0 packages failed.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).</code></pre>

<p><!--StartFragment-->Note that it hasn't been <em>completely</em> removed. The package didn't include a <code>chocolateyUninstall.ps1, </code>and Chocolatey defaults to the more conservative option, and doesn't attempt to uninstall it from the system without that script. If you'd rather it were just removed completely, even if the package doesn't have a dedicated uninstaller, you can set  <code>choco feature enable -n autoUninstaller </code>and it'll remove <em>everything</em> when you do an 'uninstall'.<br>
<br>
And of course, like any good package manager, Chocolatey can keep your packages updated. Either by name:<!--EndFragment--></p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">choco upgrade paint.net</code></pre>

<p><!--StartFragment-->or all at once:<!--EndFragment--></p>

<pre class="article__code">
<code data-lang="">choco upgrade all</code></pre>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Next time</h2>

<p><!--StartFragment-->That's all for now! At the very least, now you've got some better syntax highlighting, tab-and-auto-completion, and a nice package manager or two.<br>
Next time, we'll be talking about better Git integration, and improvements to the actual console experience. Look forward to tabs, splitting your console, and better resize support for non-Windows 10 machines!<!--EndFragment--></p>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Commercial services rely on converting users to paying customers</strong></p>

<p>The business logic of many commercial digital services revolves around the concept of a conversion funnel – or, increasingly, a repeating cycle of conversion to advocation to new conversion. Getting retail shoppers to buy your products via recipes and offers, turning media consumers to paying subscribers with compelling content or selling your physical product by being there at the moment of inspiration are all ways of converting users to paying customers.</p>

<p>The practice of mapping the steps of your customers' journey and considering how to engage them at various points throughout is standard practice in the industry. Modelling is used to make assumptions about client volumes and conversions, business cases are built on these assumptions and projects funded on the returns promised by the business cases.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/customer-engagement--vkaae7tu68_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/customer-engagement--vkaae7tu68_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Customer engagement</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What happens much less frequently is de-risking the investment by validating your volume and conversion assumptions in real life scenarios before committing to the project investment. Early validation equals early iteration, helping you not only validate business case feasibility, but also optimize your conversions from day 1. We recently did just this with one of our clients, a large global manufacturing and services company.</p>

<p><strong>The funnel in our service</strong></p>

<p>Typically, it all started with a great idea. Our client had identified an opportunity to tap into volumes of potential clients in the physical world and be there at the moment of inspiration by providing a new digital sales channel in the form of a valuable service.</p>

<p>The service in question is targeted at environments where all passers-by are known to be consumers of the product our client is manufacturing. The service itself provides a mobile accessible report, giving information on the condition of your individual product (the service has this information) and comparisons to new one with practical and understandable terms. Call-to-actions to renew your product are provided on the report page.</p>

<p>In our case, the funnel had four basic steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unique users – the overall volume of passers-by. For this we had a sensible starting estimate based on the average volumes of people in the target environments.</li>
	<li>Potential clients – a subset of unique users with a need for the product. This can be accurately calculated based on product lifetime and the fact that people in the target environment are all consumers of the product.</li>
	<li>Engaged clients – a subset of potential clients who pay attention to and engage with the new service (a click-through-rate, really). For this, we had no sensible estimates as the service in question was new, with no good reference points.</li>
	<li>Paying customers – a subset of engaged clients who actually end up purchasing the product. For this, we started with our client’s market share.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/screen-shot-2016-03-21-at-15-25-40_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/screen-shot-2016-03-21-at-15-25-40_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Our funnel</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After mapping the funnel, it was clear that, first and foremost, the question was the percentage of potential clients who actually pay attention to and engage with the service and the channel. And of course, how people would react to the service itself given its novel nature.</p>

<p><strong>Testing and validating our assumptions</strong></p>

<p>To test and validate this, we created a fake service that closely resembled the real one. The fake service had a sample report, as well as a form with a few simple questions. 40 branded flyers with the key value proposition and call to action were created to advertise the service and 40 SMS messages sent to people whose contact details were obtained from our client’s CRM system. Google analytics was used to help us track consumer behavior.</p>

<p>SMS messages were sent in two batches of 20 and flyers were distributed in two target environments during the day and during the evening. The target service itself would be free for the consumers. The cost for consumer is taking the time and effort to enter the service URL to your mobile browser or follow the SMS link.</p>

<p>Out of the 80 trial consumers, 46% engaged with the new service. This was largely independent of the advertisement medium (SMS or flyer) or the target environment. Of these, 41% also took the time to respond to our survey. With the survey respondents, the initial reaction to service messaging (that is, the SMS or the flyer) was 83% positive and reaction to the service itself was 93% positive! There were zero escalations and one person even contacted us enthusiastically later on, with ideas related to developing the service.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/click-through-rate_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/click-through-rate_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Measured engagement</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a result of this simple trial, we have a far better figure for the engagement percentage (we used 40% in our calculations vs. the measured 46%) and the overall funnel as well as business case. Given the very positive consumer reactions, we also knew we’re on the right track.</p>

<p>This trial was conducted to understand the biggest unknowns at the time: engagement percentages and consumer reaction. With this information, there’s enough backing to proceed. The goal of the next step is to validate whether we can achieve sustainable small-scale business success with the service. For this, we need to validate the technical reliability of the service, get even more accurate figures for all funnel percentages and, most importantly, test the actual conversion of service users to paying customers. This phase of development will cost around 10-15% of the final project investment (or ~2% of overall cost in case of maximal scaling scenario).</p>

<p>Of course this trial was not a single, isolated event, but rather a step in a continuous flow of lean service creation activity. It is vital to understand that in a digital service, everything influences everything else – strategy, business modelling, marketing, service design and development need to go hand in hand and iterate continuously between the abstract and the concrete.</p>

<p>Build, measure, learn, repeat.</p>

<p>I wish I could figure out a substitute for the word <em>brand </em> in the context of technology, because it's frequently met with negligence - sometimes even hostile resistance. </p>

<p>There are so many misconceptions about branding out there that it's safe to say very few people properly understand its true essence. Once we understand it s true essence, we realize we should embrace the concept of branding as the core of service design.</p>

<p>Brand may be an ugly word, but you'd better start loving it.</p>

<p>Why? Let's start with the easy part:</p>

<p>Branding will help make the digital service you are designing and building more recognizable, remarkable and memorable. Adding a catchy name, some beautiful visual design and clever growth hacking or marketing mechanisms to the product can make it stand out from the crowd. We all agree on this, right? The problem is that this is where most people stop. Don't. There's so much more to it.</p>

<p>If you leave it at that, all you'll have done is create another island in a vast ocean full of isolated islands. It's not true branding and you'll fail to reach people's hearts. Instead of superimposing a layer of branding and marketing to an otherwise completed service concept with all its features and functions defined, I'd like to challenge you to let brand design thinking guide your whole service design process from day one.</p>

<p>You'll create an ocean, not a mere island.</p>

<p>It may sound like letting the tail wag the dog, but it’s not. You just need to widen your conception of branding beyond the obvious visible elements. In the right hands brand design work can give your service an appealing story to tell and an interesting personality. Brand design can reveal the real YOU behind the good looks and give your service the sort of manners that helps make real friends. If these brand descriptors are integrated into your service design work, suddenly all the features and functions make sense and feel consistent as well as right.</p>

<p>People don’t love Airbnb because of its technical features or UX and UI alone. They love what the service stands for and what they can achieve or experience with it - the magic that happens when spending time with it. The actual features and functions feel right because they are anchored in the brand personality and promise.</p>

<p>This approach is not limited to new brands, either. Brand integration is even more important for established brands. For a while now, the advertising industry has acknowledged that modern marketing communication is not about claiming things - it'ss about behaving in a certain fashion.</p>

<p>It's so true.</p>

<p>Digital services offer plenty of touchpoints where brand behavior is tested consecutively and without mercy. During these encounters your brand will either deliver on its promises or fail to do so. Not enough thought is given to this fact. All too often services are built for the sake of it, forgetting that it should all start with the company's strategic brand and service promise. This brand and service promise should be present at all times.</p>

<p>You are in a position to change this. Get out of your marketing silo and start driving the service design process, too. They belong together. </p>

<p>Space Tyckiting! You may have noticed we've been going on about it lately. If you're not Finnish, you may have wondered what that even means. In fact, there's a good chance you've wondered about it even if you are Finnish.</p>

<p><em>Tyckiting</em> comes from the Finnish word for cannon: <em>tykki. Tykki </em>turns into <em>tykitellä </em>- the act of firing stuff off in a rapid-fire manner. It can apply to anything from funny one-liners to complaint letters. <em>Tyckiting </em>is a quasi-English bastardization of <em>tykittellä</em>.</p>

<p>Space Tyckiting is all about sending your bots into space to engage in battle with the other teams' bots. It's a coding competition we're putting on to find some coding talent all over Europe and to have some fun shooting stuff up. We've had a couple of battles already, in Tampere and Helsinki. Oulu, Turku, London, Stockholm and Berlin are coming up and the grande finale and battle royale takes place in Berlin in May.</p>

<p>In Tampere Jeeves came out on top and the Helsinki contest was won by Math.Max.</p>

<p>Check out Math.max's video interview, as well as some pics from the Tampere and Helsinki tournaments.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p class="article__paragraph">In the recent years, excellent Customer Experience has become a hot topic in boardrooms and even a strategic target. However, in many companies the activity around CX is mainly related to measuring it rather that systematically designing it. Also, research indicates, that the biggest challenges related to providing excellent CX lie in changing the organizational structures and processes to support the CX. Using Service Design tools enables the organization to manage their CX on deeper level than just measurement.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">The elements of Customer Experience</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">Nowadays, larger and larger part of the customer’s interaction with the company’s products &amp; services happens in digital channels. The customers do research and compare different options through search engines, marketing sites and social networks. They buy physical products in webshops and pay them using the digital channels and even when purchasing services, they often book them online. For many companies, digitals channels are already the primary contact point to their customers. Traditional UX and UI design focuses on designing these digital touchpoints.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">However, as whole the Customer Experience consists of many other touchpoints beyond the digital channels and also the underlying organization, processes and organizational culture are key elements in building excellent CX. When talking about physical products, their sales and delivery packaging as well as the delivery process and related personnel are all part of the CX. Also background processes related to manufacturing the product can either support or break the intended excellent experience.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">And if we talk about services, CX is greatly affected by the space where the service is provided, clothing, behavior and attitude of the customer facing personnel as well as physical products that may be consumed during the service. Also in this case all the related background processes and systems have a positive or a negative impact on the CX.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph"> </p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">The Service Design Process</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">Taking all the abovementioned factors into account makes CX design quite challenging, but this is where Service Design can help. In order to design and lead the Customer Experience, the actions of the organization need to be based on the company strategy but also on customer understanding and customer centric thinking throughout the organization and partner network. This is why Service Design process typically starts with current state analysis and gathering customer understanding. Based on these, it is possible to map the current Customer Journey, including all the touchpoints with the customer but also the underlying processes and systems. During the mapping, it is also possible to identify what is the Customer Experience in each touchpoint and what are the pain points.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Traditional UX and CX design often ends to the directly customer facing part of the product or servivce. However, this is not for optimizing the CX, because in order to provide great Customer Experiences the personnel needs to be motivated and to enjoy their job. This does not happen, if the digital &amp; physical tools used by the personnel or the working environment are not optimal for the personnel. Also the organizational structure and organization culture can either support or hinder the customer centric thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="article__paragraph">Service Design tools work well especially in environments, where the systems and processes are complex or the organization is siloed and culture is hierarchical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="article__paragraph">Service Design tools work well especially in environments, where the systems and processes are complex or the organization is siloed and culture is hierarchical. In order to successfully lead the CX, it is essential that both the management and the rest of the personnel participate the SD process. Also, the whole organization needs to truly try to understand, what kind of tools, working environment, organization and culture would allow all the involved parties to do their part in providing the excellent CX. At the same time, it is useful to map the whole value stream and process of providing the products and services. This provides means to understand which parts of the value stream actually provide value either directly to the customer or to the personnel and it is possible to remove the tasks and side products, that don’t do either.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">When current state is understood from the perspective of both customers and the personnel, the work to define the target state, related KPIs and the optimal Customer Journey can start. Based on the optimal Customer Journey it is then possible to re-design and optimize each customer touchpoint as well as the tools, processes and organizational models so essential to the employee experience in each of these touchpoints.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">It is also essential to build marketing directly into the product and service experience i.e. think about the means how satisfied customer can spread the word about the product or service. Also customer that is not satisfied needs to have channels to express their dissatisfaction and the organizational structure and processes need to support quick reaction to this kind of feedback. Great Customer Experience can also be a result from facing the unsatisfied customer as a person, taking their feedback into account and fixing the unsuccessful experience as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Co-creating the CX with customers and personnel and validating the plans with them in early phases of the project will bring cost savings, because it prevents the company from proceeding on a wrong path for too long. This is why different kind of product and service prototypes are key parts of the SD process. It is quite typical to prototype digital systems or physical products used by customers and personnel, but similarly it is possible to prototype spaces as well as service processes. Also different kind of organizational experiments are possible and recommended, even though slightly more difficult and time consuming to implement.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">In all prototyping, it is essential to compare the results to the target state and to iterate the solution based on the feedback received from the prototypes and experiments. During prototyping, it is useful to keep in mind, that there may be some change resistance among both the customers and the personnel. Co-creating the experiences with both of these groups helps to ease the pain, but especially organizational experiments and changes to tools and work processes require enough time to be spent on evaluation. The longer the existing process or tool has been in use , the harder it is to unlearn to use them so the new tools or processes should not b etoo harshly evaluated based on imminent responses.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph"> </p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Service Design is about continuous improvement</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">When the redesigned touchpoints and background processes have been published, the work isn’t still over. From this point onwards starts the traditional CX measurement, but also continuos iteration based on the measurement results. It is also essential for the organization to continously gather customer &amp; market understanding to stay on top of the ever changing needs of their customers and the market trends. Whole industries may be revolutionarized at surprising speed, if a new player enters the market and radically changes the existing practises. Also, today’s customers are active consumers, who want to compare products and services and to make choices that suit their lifestyle. They quickly move to competing products and services, if they are unhappy. Therefore, in order to survive in the today’s fast paced market, continuosly gathering customer insights and refining that data through SD activities to improved products and services should become natural part of the organizations way of working.</p>

      <title>Kaggle data science meetup at Futurice</title>
      <description>A Kaggle data science event was held in our office in Helsinki. We had three great presentations and awesome crowd. Here is what is happening in data science in Helsinki and in Kaggle.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>What’s <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>? It’s a platform for organizing data science competitions. It provides students and data science enthusiasts with an opportunity to develop their skills and win some money in competitions.</p>

<p>An active community has grown around Kaggle meetups and people involved share their knowledge and scripts openly. Kagglers and data scientists in Helsinki were looking for a place to organize an event and we were more than happy to provide a space for them. Thus, the data science community in Helsinki got together at Futurice’s office on February 24.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">We had three speakers with three interesting topics: Antti Rauhala (Futurice) introduced the Futurice approach to do data science, Michael Wallin gave a talk about Kaggle competitions and Timo Aho (Yle) presented Yle’s data architecture.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">The Futuway of doing data science</h2>

<p>In the first presentation, <a href="http://futurice.com/people/antti-rauhala">Antti Rauhala</a> talked about data driven services built by Futurice. We believe that data-driven services will only increase in importance in the future and it goes far beyond recommendation services. The applications and service of the future will have to learn to adapt to the user’s needs on a variety of levels - not the other way around, as has been the practice. Antti presented a few case studies where customer satisfaction/engagement increased substantially by using data driven solutions such as content recommendation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Kaggle data science competitions and beyond</h2>

<p>The second speaker of the event was <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wallinm1">Michael Wallin</a>, an MSc student in Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University. He’s had a fair amount of success in Kaggle competitions. The key messages in his presentation were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Getting started is easy. Just take an example script, (modify it) and run it</li>
	<li>Feature engineering is the most important part of a successful data processing pipeline</li>
	<li>Shortcomings in Kaggle competitions:
	<ul>
		<li>Competitions are divorced from real-life applications
		<ul>
			<li>Data is cleaned and given in a nice format. In real-life data is typically stored in many locations and formats, and it consists of missing values.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Competitors can try optimize model hyperparameters on test data (leaderboard)
		<ul>
			<li>And hope for not overfitting on test data</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Slides for his presentation can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uo_zBynNWFpgKQdjHMG-giHO8A-IhIQmD0O3_KESSNY/edit#slide=id.g10002cc486_0_70">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uo_zBynNWFpgKQdjHMG-giHO8A-IhIQmD0O3_KESSNY/edit#slide=id.g10002cc486_0_70</a></p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Real life data science</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahotimo">Timo Aho</a> is a data scientist PhD at Finnish Broadcasting Corporation Yle and an expert on the real-life use of data science and big data as well as the insights they provide. The key messages in his presentation were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An introduction to Yle’s advanced data architecture behind content recommendation, dashboards and strategic planning</li>
	<li>They record tens of millions of events every day and use AWS stack to process and store the data using AWS Kinesis, Lambda, RDS, S3, Elastic Beanstalk etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Timo’s talk also really showed how much needs to be done before a dataset can be used for a Kaggle competition and used to develop content recommendation or other predictive models.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Summary</h2>

<p>Based on the feedback we received, the event was a great success. We had good talks and some great discussion. We hope that it encouraged participants to team up with each other and participate in future Kaggle data science competitions. Since it went so well, we'll definitely organize more data science events in the future, so stay tuned. While waiting for the next event, you can check upcoming Data Science Helsinki meet-ups at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Helsinki-Data-Analytics-Science-Meetup/">http://www.meetup.com/Helsinki-Data-Analytics-Science-Meetup/</a></p>

        <![CDATA[<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Being a designer is often about observing all things clever and beautiful. Even without conscious effort, all kinds of stuff gets stored somewhere in our neural network all the time. Scraps and details then bubble under without us even noticing it, gradually working their way out, to be born as something new. Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes you in a middle of a hot shower. Time freezes, soap runs into your eyes as you are trying to hold on to the thought.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">For visually trained or skilled people, stepping out of the shower and doodling something quick and dirty to be processed into something more elaborate later on isn’t a problem. However, if you aren’t visually skilled by nature, it’s sometimes a struggle to visualize the idea.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">It might take years to study the history, nuances and techniques of visual design. However there are a few basic rules that’ll guide you towards a visually coherent and understandable outcome. Whether it’s a powerpoint deck or a layout sketch you are doing, these basic guidelines will give you the building blocks for professional looking end result.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">It’s all in our heads</h2>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">It’s important to understand some of the basics of human psychology to comprehend how people most often see things and organise visual elements. We are all individuals and we interpret the world in different ways, but luckily there are some general similarities. So called Gestalt principles are used for explaining the most basic functions of human perception.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Rather than explaining the principles in this blog post, I’d suggest studying them from <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/gestalt-theory-10134960">this</a> article. Gestalt theories can be used as a validation tool for every design. Instead of scrutinising every single Gestalt principle one by one, try to learn them by heart and utilise them while crafting the design.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2"> </h2>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Basics that make all the difference</h2>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Balance</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Balance in design is similar to balance in physics. A large shape close to the center can be balanced by a small shape close to the edge. A large light toned shape can be balanced by a small dark toned shape as the darker shape appears to be heavier.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Dominance</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Elements in a composition will either appear equal or one will exert some level of dominance over the others. The dominant element will attract the eye and get noticed first. To control dominance and to set different visual weights, the basic design elements such as colour, value, size, direction and shape can be used to create the effect.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Hierarchy</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Hierarchy is the order in which the elements within a composition are understood to be. The visual relation between elements creates logical order. Hierarchy can be built with placement, isolation and contrast. A single distinctive elements will most likely be perceived as being on top of the hierarchy.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Rhythm and continuation</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Our senses easily recognise patterns and begin to expect changes according to them, like beats in music. Visual repetition increases predictability and helps the viewer to understand logical entities and order. A break in a rhythm also breaks the flow and draws attention. Visual breaks are effective in dividing content to sections. It can also be used to display divergent content without breaking the hierarchy.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Typography</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">To put it simply, typography is making words do their job of conveying information in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Typography affects comprehension and perception - the process of understanding and perceiving information. It directs the reader’s focus. Sloppy typography consumes energy and time, a good one improves the reader’s efficiency. Typography also creates hierarchy by forming a visual route through the content.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Colour</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Here comes the hard part. Colours are highly subjective. The concealed messages that colours have are often driven by personal taste, culture and context. However, there are a few basic rules to help you create a successful colour scheme.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr"><strong>Consider the target audience:</strong> always study both the demographics and the cultural environment.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr"><strong>Pick colours from source assets</strong> like logos, branding material and photographs identified with the theme.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr"><strong>Use shades and tints.</strong> Many successful colour schemes are made entirely with shades and tints of only one anchor colour.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use complementary colours as focal points</strong> as the complementary scheme is intrinsically high-contrast and draws maximum attention. Be careful though, as complementary colours also create unwanted effects and eye sores when placed closely in full hue.</p>

</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Keep it simple</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">Stick to a simple collection of fonts. If you are unsure of good font combinations, create visual uniformity by applying only one font family to your design. Use a typeface or font family that has a selection of variants, such as italic, bold and condensed, to keep options open.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Make sure every element has a reason to be in the design and keep the number of fonts, colours and shapes to a minimum.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>Give it room to breathe</strong></h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">Respect the space of other elements. Surround words with white space to let elements breathe. Space around text boxes, images and other graphic elements makes a design easier to comprehend. Use letter spacing to fill dead space, aligning text, or condense words that take up too much space.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/align_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/align_s600x0_q85_noupscale.jpg"></a></div>
</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Make it coherent</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">Apply clear alignment to gain balanced and clear compositions. Use grids to place images and text. Horizontal and vertical lines are a great way to divide content, but remember that empty space also creates a line.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Apply colour or scale to create hierarchy. The most visually dominant feature in a design should be the most important part of the message.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Validate</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Visual hierarchy can be tested out with a simple test. Take a look at your layout, squint your eyes and see if the visual hierarchy is still clear enough to understand.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ensure that there’s enough contrast for good legibility. Crop background images so that there’s as much room for text as possible.</p>

</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Be creative, borrow with pride</h3>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Gather ideas and inspirational details before you begin to create. The research process always gives fuel for the creative process.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph" dir="ltr">Use inspirational materials and websites to find styles and effects you are after. Replicate the typography, the layout or the overall colour scheme and use it with your own content. But don’t stop there! Play around until the design looks like something you created.</p>

</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">​Undo and try again!</h3>

<p>Design is all about trial and error. Keep pushing the designs until you like what you see. The most used button of the design process is often ‘undo’.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2"> </h2>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Seeing is believing</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Visualisation is <a href="http://blog.wyzowl.com/power-visual-communication-infographic">the most effective way to communicate</a>. The tricky part is to ensure that the message gets through as intended.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If the message is simple and the basic rules of design are used correctly, our brain will do the rest of the work. Think of a stop sign as an example. Even if you haven’t been sipping bad coffee in a driving school, you still probably understand the basic signal delivered. The colour says “Look at me, I’m important!”. The shape says “I’m here to tell you something different than the other signs”. And finally the text underlines the true meaning by shouting “Stop!”.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Good design should always aim to be self-explanatory, but that doesn’t stand a chance if the basics are wonky. As with the stop sign, some form of verbal communication is often needed to emphasize the message and to leave a memory trace. Once the trace is strong enough, the words aren’t needed anymore. Most of us know what that red hexagon on a pole means even without the word in the middle.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Follow the basic visual design rules and your chances of getting the message right multiply. A solid visual appearance not only helps you explain things, but also shares the burst of energy you had while having that shower.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Futurice’s social responsibility program <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/">Spice</a> is ambitiously aiming to make Futurice a better company and the world a better place by sponsoring employees’ free time open source contributions, and now also social inclusion and digital open education efforts. The actual meters for proving the program’s impact have been missing though.</p>

<p>To change this, I’m working three months in a project funded by <a href="https://www.tekes.fi/en/">Tekes</a>, developing measures for the Spice Program’s impact on Futurice and its employees. The focus has been on impact in the company context, rather than on wider societal impact and the <em>making the world better place</em> part.</p>

<p>Although doing good is worthy in its own right, and social responsibility activities can be supported by moral arguments like “it’s the right thing to do”, they can also be assessed from more strategic perspectives, as social responsibility initiatives can create positive business effects, too. To assess and improve these, you need to have metrics of course.</p>

<p>In this case, <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/sponsoring-free-time-open-source-activities">assumptions </a>about the benefits of the Spice Program have been the starting point for meter development. The main assumptions we are testing are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>supporting recruitment by attracting talented people,</li>
	<li>learning new skills that are valuable at work,</li>
	<li>strengthening <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/158743/stenberg.pdf?sequence=3">employee engagement</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, social responsibility activities might be positively related to attracting, motivating and retaining talented people, as well as competence development, and thus very focal HC (human capital) topics. These can also have financial value due to lower costs related to employee turnover or recruitment. In addition, and related to these, social responsibility initiatives may feed innovative company culture and lead to service innovations, not to forget the improvements in the company brand image. But as the schedule is quite tight, focus in creating metrics has been primarily in learning, recruitment and employee engagement.</p>

<p><strong>What have we learned so far?</strong></p>

<p>In January we sent a short survey on learning to Spice program participants to give us a better idea whether or not they have learned professionally relevant skills via Spice activities during the past 12 months, how frequently they have contributed and what kind of things they’ve learned. Because the Spice program contributions are made on participants’ free time, we were also interested if they’ve been able to apply those skills at work.</p>

<p>The survey was sent to 54 Spice Program participants, and 37 of them answered to it. Some graphs about the results were introduced in recent<a href="http://futurice.com/blog/year-2015-in-company-sponsored-open-source"> blog post</a>, and according to responses, participating in Spice Program activities had really improved their professional skills. Assessed on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), 22 participants (59 %) agreed strongly and 14 participants (39 %) agreed on this one, and the mean was 4,57. (And yes, calculating mean from ordinal data is actually silly, but it gives you the idea.) Respondents also described their learnings in detail, and the <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/assets/docs/Spice2015Learnings.pdf">list</a> is quite extensive.</p>

<p>Participants mostly agreed (21 people, 57 %) or strongly agreed (12 people, 32 %) that they had been able to use those learned skills at work (mean 4,14). The frequency of contributions was assessed on weekly, monthly or less than monthly basis. This categorization seems too vague since 24 participants had contributed less than monthly anyway, and frequency didn’t seem to be related to learning outcomes or applying skills at work. One respondent described successfully applying learned skills “I haven't made many contributions - but those I have made I have been able to use directly in my project work at Futurice, as well as gain deeper knowledge of the open source tools we use daily”.</p>

<p>Next time, application of skills needs to be asked more closely to get a more complete picture of how participants are using the acquired skills at work, and if they think they aren’t able to use them at their work, why is that. It’s probably mostly related to the type of the contribution and the kind of work participants have. Professional skills gained via open source contributions might be more directly applicable in many work projects at Futurice than skills learned through code school teaching, for example.</p>

<p>Some people might even be participating in Spice activities because their current work tasks are not challenging and meaningful enough, and perhaps these kind of positions don’t offer as many options to apply new skills, either. And finally, even though company sponsored Spice Program contributions are made on one’s spare time and in projects that interest participants, so being able to use those skills at one’s work is merely a nice bonus from company perspective, not something you should require.</p>

<p>To conclude from the first results: Spice participants are really learning skills valuable at work, but there’s still more potential to apply those increased professional skills in their work projects. The impact Spice Program has on recruitment and employee engagement will be unveiled later on. In the meantime, feel free to share your thoughts on these topics with me.</p>

      <description>Is your service awesome? Great. It needs a brand. </description>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Yes, it's yet another Venn diagram</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The world is accelerating and gaining in complexity. There is more of everything now, especially information. The wealth of choices we have in our everyday lives sometimes makes finding the optimal products and services to fulfill our needs a challenge.</p>

<p>There are loads of services that excel in technical implementation, but few people know of them. There are ones that ride their fancy brand into the sunset, but really offer very little to the user.</p>

<p>A truly great service always has a great brand. A great brand is never an accident or a byproduct of the UX design process. A great brand is a combination of branding, marketing and go-to-market strategy and it ensures that people can form an emotional connection to the service and that the service reaches the right audience from day one.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">Faster, iterative marketing</h3>

<p>Like software development, marketing is becoming an iterative process:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create assumptions and plan</li>
	<li>Perform initial research</li>
	<li>Get real-life data</li>
	<li>Adjust plan accordingly</li>
</ol>

<p>The clock speed for branding and marketing is getting faster, enabling brand building on a completely new level of speed and agility. Experiments are run in hours or days - not weeks or months. And by experiments we are not referring to A/B-testing. Often, a six-month newspaper or TV campaign is really not what the doctor ordered. Running rapid experiments on social media and websites or at physical locations might be the right solution, especially if the campaigns can be quickly adjusted when problems arise or gold is struck.</p>

<p>Say we’re launching a service we assumed would be used primarily by teenagers, but ends up appealing to seniors, adjustments have to be made to the design as well as the technical solutions employed. The brand and marketing also need to play ball and react.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">
<br>
Uncharted territory</h3>

<p>Let’s take a step back. The three main things to consider when doing something new: time, effort and costs.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/slide6_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>
</figure>

<p>In many companies, getting a large budget for extending an existing service is easier than a smaller budget for a new service. The thinking is that the investment in an existing business is less risky, but it also yields smaller rewards. New business has much higher risks, but also potentially greater rewards.</p>

<p>Once the decision has been made to invest in something new, money is no longer the primary issue – it’s time and effort. In other words: how fast can we get something new to customers and where do we find the people to make it - with the latter intimately tied to the former. Top performers are already tied to business-critical projects that consume more than their allotted time, so even if you succeed in finding the right people, some are going to be tied to previous commitments. Especially for larger organizations, getting a project team together is no small feat. There’s a hell of a lot of syncing to do. It’s a hard calendar puzzle to crack and major source for inertia. Often building a new service requires experts from business, marketing, technology and design, from inside and outside the company. A fairly standard case might involve a business consultancy firm, a marketing agency, a design shop, a tech company and a few others.</p>

<p>That’s quite a mix.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/slide4_s600x0_q85_noupscale.jpg"></div>
</figure>

<p>Chances are great that somewhere along the line communication will become garbled and problems in critical cut over points will ensue - from business case to design, from design to implementation and from marketing to anything. There are too many business plans without a technology point of view or nice visual designs without a clear user journey and experience. Or a great service missing a brand that makes it lovable. How the hell do we make it work? As we’ve seen, there are quite a few factors to take into account, but fear not: there’s a new method in town. End-to -end service creation using all the necessary competences.</p>

<p>The process has three main phases.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph"><strong>1. Concepting and branding.</strong></p>

<p>Concepting = business case + service design + MVP content<br>
Branding = initial brand + marketing plan + go-to-market strategy</p>

<p>In this phase we gather as much information as possible from potential users. We create wireframes. We make important decisions about tech that have a major impact on implementation estimates. Words like native, hybrid, React Native, Elm, Cycle.js or Xamarin (maybe not) will be thrown around.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph"><strong>2. Implementation</strong></p>

<p>We create the first version of the service using appropriate web or mobile technologies, UX design, analytics, etc. This is the grunt phase of the project, where earlier plans and decisions start to take shape. The team works through the backlog and, sprint by sprint, the MVP is formed.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph"><strong>3. MVP release</strong></p>

<p>In this phase, the service is released to the wild and all the previous work is put to a real test. Once people start using the service start, the analytics start to gather data on how it’s used and by whom. The brand and marketing team finally gets some first-hand intelligence on how the initial plan is working and is able to iterate the plan.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/slide3_s600x0_q85_noupscale.jpg"></div>
</figure>

<p>The whole process may last one to three months and a few of the key people should be involved throughout the duration to ensure continuity: project lead, tech lead, design lead and/or brand lead. The core team from the customer side participates and learns all through the project, so the eventual handover goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p>Does all this imply that you are locked to a single vendor? Definitely not. As long as the company that owns the service also owns the rights to all the material produced in the project, a handover of any part can be made at any time.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the point?</strong></p>

<p>The point is: the next time you plan to create a new service, think about whether anyone will ever know about it and could it be released in a fraction of the time you originally planned.</p>

</div>

<p>Interaction Design Association's (IxDA) Interaction16 is held in Helsinki, Finland on March 1-4. As one of the <a href="http://interaction16.ixda.org/partners/">official partners</a>, we'll have a booth at Finlandia Hall and host some related activities at our offce in downtown Helsinki, a hop, skip and a jump from the conference venue. </p>

<p class="article__paragraph">What ARE we doing at Interaction16?</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Workshops</h4>

<p>They take place Tuesday, March 1. </p>

<p>In the morning, we'll be exploring the co-creation of tomorrow's services at the <a href="http://interaction16.ixda.org/workshops/creating-tomorrows-services-together/"><em>Creating tomorrow's services, together</em></a> workshop. <a href="http://futurice.com/people/jane-vita">Jane Vita</a>, <a href="http://futurice.com/people/ricardo-brito">Ricardo Brito</a> and <a href="http://futurice.com/people/paul-houghton">Paul Houghton</a> will help participants use tools and methodologies like the IoT Service Kit (see video above), Trend Cards and Lean Service Creation to create scenarios for digital services that mold our future. </p>

<p>The afternoon session concentrates on storytelling and how we can use this most powerful way to form human connections to create better services: <em><a href="http://interaction16.ixda.org/workshops/storytelling-in-digital-service-design/">Storytelling in Digital Service Design</a></em>. <a href="http://futurice.com/people/mlumiaho">Maria Lumiaho</a>, <a href="http://futurice.com/people/jane-vita">Jane Vita</a> and <a href="http://futurice.com/people/suvi-numminen">Suvi Numminen</a> will help particiapnts forget about the tools and technologies and focus on emotion and experience. </p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Booth number 3 (we assume)</h4>

<p>You'll find us between Spotify and Salesforce. I'm sorely tempted to start reading a deeper meaning into this accidental location, but I think I'll refrain. </p>

<p>At the booth we'll feature the <a href="http://iotservicekit.com/">IoT Service Kit</a>. Want to try your hand at creating service scenarios? Visit our booth. Our designers will be on hand to help you use the kit. We'll have a competition set up and some awesome goodies to give away. </p>

<p><a href="http://spiceprogram.org/">Spice</a> is our open source and social impact program. It's been runing for a year and looks more and more like a <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/year-2015-in-company-sponsored-open-source">WIN-WIN situation</a> for all involved. We'll have some info about Spice and the Chilicorn as well as some related exercises (it'll only take a minute...) you can do to help us develop the program in an even more impactful direction at the booth. </p>

      <title>Why you should pay employees for free-time Open Source contributions</title>
      <description>After a full year of actively sponsoring employee open source contributions, what have we learned? Lots!</description>

        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Late in the year 2014 we at Futurice began to sponsor <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/oss-sponsorship/">employee free time open source</a> contributions. What has happened since? Let’s take a look at the year 2015.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Based on some early feedback I want to clarify that our Open Source sponsorship has nothing to do with company (or customer) owned software projects. Each employee decides what she wants to spend her time on, if anything. Mainly the sponsored hours have gone towards small internal projects, as you can see from the map visualisation below. Doesn't have to be software either; there have been hobby related blog posts, even <a href="https://github.com/ykarikos/sheet-music">sheet music</a>. You can find all the minutiae <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/oss-sponsorship/">in here</a>. </p>

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Our sponsorship model has remained the same. €15 paid per reported hour, max 30 hours monthly. Anything goes, as long as it is Open Source.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2015 we paid sponsorship money based on 400 reports by 60 different people, working on 150 different projects, spending a sum of 2500 reported hours. This cost the company €37500. In 2015 Futurice had about 240 employees.</p>

<h2>Projects and technologies</h2>

<p dir="ltr">After the sponsorship had been in place for 3-4 months, this being February 2015, I made a slightly humorous (or naivistic) map visualisation of the projects we had contributed to up to that point.</p>

<p><a href="http://spiceprogram.org/assets/img/realm-of-the-chilicorn-2015-02.png"><img alt="realm-of-the-chilicorn-midsize.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AnHAb8I2YNPPi9jR_mw37v-4DwPhl7p8j6KPW_vdyNIrIQNRJalGmiju_2Nas-R8gvmRCzWE88SpJZ8d_YQuhAKfF08fQlLiKyEvbLWn58sRfsKsbp-U2NQ-mtQi3Y_VOi-CNhAa"></a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Each country is a (roughly defined) technology area, cities represent the projects that our people have contributed to and reported it for the sponsorship program.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our people liked the map a lot, but despite my deep understanding of Microsoft Paint, its creation was quite a lot of work. I started to think about how to automate the updating of it and some steps were taken in that direction, but never completed. So the map hasn’t been updated. Until now.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It took several working days with Microsoft Paint to update the map to the end of 2015 status. There are way too many projects now; it is not feasible to continue, as the map gets too crowded. This time I saved between every addition, so there’s a video!</p>

</div>

<p dir="ltr">This is the final version of the map, dated December 31st 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://spiceprogram.org/assets/img/realm-of-the-chilicorn-2015-12.png"><img alt="prefix_realm-188.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Fgk5arPQrYz7VUxZC-Eylc6ofzDlJSfAujucWeNvRmMQMTfMNu6-lXHZSNQ6Dy6IpjKvBDkjWBpb4WbU4tfSs0sMKT1v3BQlSUQp8ShZnrFKrT4JXK9i97wBY8i4ZD8ZyGbNZwv2"></a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Yeah, it’s gotten crowded. Would have to annex neighbouring countries to continue. </p>

<p dir="ltr">I am delighted to find so many external projects (identified by squares) on the map. It’s safe to say our employees have contributed widely and are building the new digital world.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Next up, some thoughts about the value generation.</p>

<h2>Competence development</h2>

<p dir="ltr">We did a learning survey recently, focusing on these sponsored free time (open source) activities.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How often have you participated in sponsored activities?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><img alt="charts-learning-how-often.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fdFKqcHInXQrWC1DzF_mcDrJunFVfWUTBE6yGpFa9UCsnUA6inRk9WMeLF-SAqVoXmS1yYKdW00rJRnVZURghzgclXaWdhvj6QkbODrwo8_2Zn7bn5EBOkCXfT01-jWbezp0CTdP"><strong>Do you think that your professional competence has improved as a result?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><img alt="charts-learning-professional-improvement.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LuLrEkyH7Wr8JbExvCjBuHltSZtSEKqGHXjF93soI1TgkcLYr5H6GzPDSiGYQkOhf0MbjaBux7h3ls92r4zhvAXu9iDrQW_oqsFV9hmNRQ-vPyHs8q8AGpXsmAUD319HmoeJnPYV"><strong>Have you had a chance to use the learned skills in your work?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><img alt="charts-learning-used-at-work.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oOxmlNNcO15unclLk4vcBI6m3CU7MclAzs0T6wqEd8Tezqzb7x_vmRXMEYFigtIL1whS6y0FcQL5TrfrLgaNa1PuyihUqTtqMIa9dNYSNr8D-Qm1GKCdHk8Ix18eCLeRIStucBYD"></p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition we requested people to list examples of what they think they have learned. We got responses such as:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Learned React + Redux (lots of it).</p>

<p>Got practical experience and more understanding about Node.js, npm, and bacon.js.</p>

<p>Really used TDD for the first time ever :)</p>

<p>Learned enough of the JSPM ecosystem to know I wouldn't recommend it to be used in our current customer project.</p>

<p>React/Flux, Postgres, Clojure, and general backend stuff. I've used everything except Clojure in recent projects.</p>

<p>Learned to program in Clojure and then used that knowledge of Clojure for a customer project.</p>

<p>How a video streaming protocol work, about distributed computing on Apache Spark, and to explain programming concepts to high school kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">People listed a lot of things, you can find a more complete list slightly edited for readability and company confidentiality purposes <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/assets/docs/Spice2015Learnings.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Recruitment</h2>

<p dir="ltr">We now systematically collect information in the recruitment process to help us assess the impact of different things, such as the open source sponsorship. This is fairly new and we don’t have enough data yet to publish any results.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Here’s an actual quote from our lead recruiter that I have not asked for permission to use:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">After two days at a job fair in London, the Spice Program works really well in our favour in attracting developers. Since the job market here is challenging and relies heavily on headhunters, it’s of great value.</p>

<p dir="ltr">- <a href="http://futurice.com/people/tuomas-paasonen">Tuomas Paasonen</a>, Lead Recruiter, Futurice</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">The signals from other people who work with recruitment have been consistent, so at least the perceived value is high. Let’s get back to recruitment value soon, when we have real data.</p>

<h2>PR and brand</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Media visibility has been a bigger challenge. Reporters do not much care about Open Source. I suppose it is considered an overly technical subject.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We should put more effort into making our message and achievements visible in social media. It would be nice to find a way to succeed in that without having to join shouting matches or resorting to communication characterised by an abundance of superlatives and a definitive lack of content.</p>

<p>The key to media visibility is likely in the actual projects we do, instead of in the way we do things. Talking about the projects lets us tell better stories. 2016 will prove this theory right or wrong, as we are trying to carefully funnel a part of the combined company and community effort towards good causes.</p>

<h2>Employee engagement</h2>

<p dir="ltr">We had the pleasure to provide data and contacts to Erik Stenberg’s graduation work for the <a href="https://www.hanken.fi/en">Hanken School of Economics</a> last year with the apt title: “<a href="http://spiceprogram.org/assets/docs/Pro%20Gradu%20-%20Erik%20Stenberg%20094170.pdf">Spicing up employee engagement - A case study of an open source program</a>”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Erik’s study looked into how work-related extra-role activities, such as that exemplified by the Spice Program, could affect employee engagement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The definition of employee engagement he selected for his study is by Schaufeli &amp; Bakker: Engagement is “a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind, characterised by vigour, dedication and absorption”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The first question, "Does program participation have an impact on engagement?", he approached with a questionnaire based on the UWES-9 framework that numerically assesses employee engagement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The second question, "How can the impact (or lack thereof) be explained?", was studied through interviews with the Spice Program participants.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Erik found the following positive effects to employee engagement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">An improved sense of membership in the work community</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Alignment with the values promoted by the program</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Personal attachment to the program identity</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Competence improvement and increasing confidence</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Autonomy to pursue interests and needs</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Signals of approval from the employer</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">These are good, these are right. Interesting detail; the people active in our program actually have a bit lower overall engagement than in general. The fact that they work alone more often than your average Futurice employee probably explains it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The sole unmistakably negative effect:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Unintended strain from excessive program engagement</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the one we try to tackle with the 30 hour monthly limit.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">We decided to continue this sponsorship for now.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I am aware of several other companies that have launched a similar arrangement, or are considering it. Our experiences indicate that the benefits greatly outweigh the costs, even if you only consider the tangible business value.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our <a href="https://extranet.tekes.fi/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_webapp=/ibi_apps&amp;IBIC_server=EDASERVE&amp;IBIWF_msgviewer=OFF&amp;IBIF_ex=O_PROJEKTI_RAP1&amp;CLICKED_ON=&amp;YPROJEKTI=12219883&amp;YTARKASTELU=Z&amp;YKIELI=S&amp;YHANKETYYPPI=11&amp;IBIAPP_app=opendata&amp;YMUOTO=HTML">publicly funded sub-project</a> developing methods and value measurements will start reporting results very soon. We will publish all that - and we are happy to talk about it to anyone who listens :)</p>

<p dir="ltr">I'll be happy to discuss anything related, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/hippielobster">catch me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph">Comptel is bringing to market a brilliant and game changing, but fairly complex concept: "Our challenge was communicating the idea as well as its concrete value. The benefits to our audience must be presented in a manner that is quick and easy to grasp," says Simo Karkkulainen from Comptel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We want to show what Comptel can deliver today"<br>
- Jukka Jänönen, Comptel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comptel and Futurice teamed up to create an engaging experience based on smooth touch based interaction, clear visualisation and engaging gamification that communicates the concept's practical value in daily life.</p>

<p>Futurice and Comptel put together a compact team of domain, marketing, design and tech makers. The dominant working mode was <em>"pragmatic lean with daily iterations"</em>. The team started with a one sheet sketch on paper. After few weeks and several rounds of paper prototyping, some serious Unity hacking and constant user testing, the digital experience is ready to create a buzz at MWC 2016.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Simo pointing at things</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>"Futuriceans were a part of the team from day one. Direct communication and working together on the same premises made short iteration cycles and fast progress possible," says <strong>Simo Karkkulainen</strong>.</p>

<p>While testing the solution, the team noticed that the solution was a also great tool for internal communication. "Our common understanding has increased and our own organization now has a better understanding of this new business area," says <strong>Jukka Jänönen</strong> from Comptel.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>What kind of company are you?</strong></p>

<p>That's a question a lot of people ask me and one that I always find a little bit tricky to answer with an air of complete confidence. There are good reasons for this. Futurice is growing rapidly and continuously developing our offer. To be honest we are not there yet. (not sure you ever are in this business) Futurice is in a very exciting transitional phase and this is one of the reasons I love working here. I like to build things.</p>

<p>Take the metaphor of a 16 year old teenager, same age as Futurice. Can you remember how you felt? I know for sure that I was kinda awkward, a bit not sure of myself, always feeling that I didn't fit well in my clothes and self conscious of how others saw me. The words that came out of my mouth never seemed to hit the desired target, especially when it came to chatting up girls:-)  For sure I had not developed the confidence I have now as a middle aged man and I think it's the same for companies too, it takes time to reach maturity and gain that air of self awareness and confidence. Even more challenging when the business and digital environment is shifting fast before your very eyes.</p>

<p>From the inside, it's always interesting to wonder how others perceive Futurice and whether the external perception aligns with the internal perception? Usually these two are out of sync and it's a constant battle to keep it up to date and help our clients and the industry understand what we do and where we deliver value.</p>

<p>When you do achieve that nirvana however, there's not much that can hold you back and when the planets align you can clearly see the impact in the happiness of our people, the happiness of our clients and the quality and success of our work, not to mention the company profitability. It's always nice to hear others outside Futurice saying good things about you too. I feel that Futurice is now rather close to our nirvana and the next couple of years will really see this ship take flight on a global impact mission that I want to be part of.</p>

<p>But let's get back to perception as we still have a job to do:</p>

<p>If you are Finnish, live and work in Finland and have a history in this market with software and all things digital, you probably see Futurice as a big software development house with an award winning working culture. One of the digital leaders in the market with a great reputation for delivery and getting shit done. Thankfully in this case the perception aligns quite well with the reality but maybe a little behind the internal reality or at the least our ambition level.</p>

<p>If you come across us in our international offices the perception may be very different and in the worst case people have no perception of Futurice at all. This of course has its pros and cons. Not being known gives us a level of freedom in how we position ourselves but also brings challenges against the more well know local competitors and also attracting local talent.</p>

<p>So with this in mind I wanted to take the opportunity to communicate to the world some of the internal developments going on at Futurice and how the company is beginning to blossom into a rather big and beautiful flower. Allow me to alter your perception.</p>

<p><strong>Our internationality:</strong></p>

<p>Over the last few years Futurice has greatly increased its presence across Europe and opened four international offices in Berlin, London, Munich and Stockholm as well as its long established Finnish offices in Helsinki and Tampere.  This growth has come mainly through organic client based relationships and by doing great work with our existing international clients in Finland. To echo this international flavour, we have hired multi-cultural employees, if I'm not mistaken over 18 nationalities are represented. Our working language is English. I personally now receive CV's from designers from all over the world, India, China, America and even as far as Australia. This definitely was not the case only a couple of years ago and goes to show that the good word about Futurice is getting out there. I've also felt the sharp end of this growing internationality in my own projects, as there are times when I've been in three countries in one week!</p>

<p><strong>Our vision:</strong></p>

<p>Futurice has a compelling and ambitious vision for 2020. We are aiming to be recognised globally as "Builders, Innovators and Change Agents" working together with ambitious clients at multiple levels from <strong>advisory</strong> to <strong>visionary </strong>and most importantly in the <strong>delivery </strong>of the digital products and services we build for them. I'm very happy to report that we are well on our way. Across the company we have many examples of client relationships that enable these type of engagements and a growing number of key accounts where we work in all three modes which is super rewarding and I think helps us deliver our best work. </p>

<p>The good thing is that our clients are proactively asking us to take a bigger role in their business. They see Futurice as a "hands on"  fast and concrete alternative to the more traditional management consultants. One obvious differentiator is that Futurice has the design and build expertise so we can take high level strategic work all the way through to market. We can also coach and support internal client teams to build best in class digital practices, methodology and teams with the right mindset and culture for the digital age.</p>

<p><strong>Our competence:</strong></p>

<p>In my view the main transformation our company has been going through is from the traditional agile development software house to a full service, multi-disciplinary consultancy offering our clients a reliable and trustworthy one stop shop for the digital revolution. What Futurice has understood is that companies need support and expertise on how to deal with digital disruption as it impacts their business in many different ways. For this reason Futurice had to evolve.</p>

<p>We created a new way of working called Lean Service Creation (LSC) as a way to successfully navigate our clients digital business by bringing together the best practises from Agile, Design Thinking and Lean Startup. We assemble multi-disciplinary teams ensuring a holistic view of the problem to solve, we do all our work with a collaborative, proactive nature that stems from our culture of empowerment and transparency and no bullshit attitude.</p>

<p>On the design side alone we have more than doubled our numbers in two years and have grown not only in size but also in breadth of skill. Currently Futurice has designers that are experts in the fuzzy front end business and service design through to user experience and user interface designers to creative visual designers and detail freaks that even design their own fonts. Many of Futurice's designers can also turn their hands to coding and like to dabble in the tech as much as they do design.</p>

<p>In recent months Futurice has hired people from the traditional advertising agencies, brand strategists, art directors and creative's. These new talents help us bring a brand savvy-ness and visuality to our services. Futurice even has its own business unit that focuses on this brand centric work and is developing new lean tools to design brands from scratch and take them all the way to realisation.</p>

<p><strong>Our Voice:</strong></p>

<p>Futurice has always been a modest, very Finnish company and that modesty is admirable but sometimes hinders us when it comes to letting the world know how good we are. I'll always remember from an early age some lyrics by Morrissey from the British band "The Smiths" he wrote in the 1986 song Ask "<em>shyness is nice but shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you'd like to" </em> I'm happy to say that it's not that we are shy anymore, it's just that we are thinking much more before we speak and we are now speaking on an international stage. The scale of noise and competitive voices on a global level is mind-boggling, so Futurice therefore is actively investing in building a team internally who help us deliver our message in a stronger and more targeted manner.</p>

<p>Futurice has invested in many internal and external initiatives to increase our share of voice. You may have noticed the increase in articles and blogs in social media and also the events hosted by Futurice. We now have an established stand at Slush every year and many people around the company talking at key events and passionately writing thought pieces for the industry. </p>

<p>I feel that it's in our voice where all things come together but its in our people and work where the stories and content originate. Luckily Futurice is attracting and hiring some of the most talented people in the world and getting the chance to do some of the most interesting and impactful work out there in four European markets.</p>

<p>Exciting times to be working at Futurice and also a great time to be working with us. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>How to draw an analogy between freeride snowboarding and brand building. In this blog post I want to talk about the two biggest passions of my life. In doing so, I'm going to show how the two are similar, in ways that might not be obvious at first glance.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/img4--wuqibgu7o7_s600x0_q85_noupscale.jpg"></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Me snowboarding in Austria</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p dir="ltr">Before joining Futurice as a brand and marketing designer, I spent my winters finding good snow and competing around Europe as <a href="https://vimeo.com/147645861">a freeride snowboarder</a>. Now my passion is to create coherent and memorable brand experiences, where offline and online form a sweet bond together.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Imagination is the key</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Freeride snowboarding is recognised as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejqOZdZT2jU">a competitive sport</a>, and the contest format is very simple: Line choice, air&amp;style (referring to jumps/tricks), fluidity, control, and technique are the five criteria by which freeriding is judged. There‘s a start gate at the summit and a finish gate at the bottom. Competitors use their imagination to make the best of the natural terrain features on the mountainside. The best run down wins: easy. But what does this have to do with branding? Imagination is a crucial ability also in brand building. Great brands are born from unique ideas fueled by great imagination.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Taking risks</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Just like in freeride competitions, in branding you can also play it safe, but then you won’t really stand out from the crowd. Or you can take a calculated risk and win big… or lose big. The perceived benefits derived from a product or service can be represented in consumers’ minds in unintended ways. For example for a luxury brand symbolic associations and perception of exclusivity is crucial. The increased accessibility of a luxury product or service threatens the image of exclusivity. What used to be perceived as luxury has gone too “mainstream”. Therefore you need to choose your strategy carefully and adapt it wisely. The magic in taking calculated risks is to have a realistic relationship with yourself and with your brand and your abilities to evaluate the risk. Of course you are trying to maximise the probability of success at the same time. No matter if you are a freeride athlete or a brand manager, every single element in your performance should <a href="https://brand.uber.com/">provide a coherent experience</a> for your audience. Let's go back to the five freeriding criteria I mentioned earlier. Can we apply these wholesale to branding as well?</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Style</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Style is a crucial judgment criteria in freeriding. Some riders have more than others. The same applies to branding. Consumers are the judges of your branding efforts, and the brand design is your style. If you have a good style you may gain few extra points from the judges. Style is linked with jumping: jumping is the very reason that freeride competitions are so exciting. You ask why? Because it’s something you can’t fake - what you see is what you get. Style and aggression play a huge part in jumping. In freeriding you’ll get extra points for jumping big and showing you know where you are at all times. You need to be performing with full control before, during and after the jump. Just like your customers might appreciate <a href="http://voiceandtone.com/">a clear personal brand message</a> that is also authentic and allows them to emotionally connect with your brand.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Line choice</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Line choice is the path a freerider chooses to take down the mountain. The judges need to pay special attention to how unique, imaginative and difficult the route is compared to other riders. Line choice is like a brand journey. By brand journey I mean all the brand elements that must be there when someone consumes your offer. It is the design of the brand experience that you are trying to offer for your audience. Freeride athletes are the brand managers of their very own unique brand; themselves. Line choice is being “designed” in advance during a face check, a visual inspection through binoculars of the contest area found on the mountainside. Participants can’t ride the face of a mountain in question before the contest. Athlete brands or branded products and services which are able to be original and add some wow-factor score the highest.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Fluidity</h4>

<p dir="ltr">The idea behind fluidity criteria is pretty simple. If you hesitate or lose your pace, you will lose points. Brands, in order to keep up the pace, need to create continuous experiences across all marketing channels by delivering the right content at the right time. It is all about learning to know who your customers are, what they like and catering to them. You need to optimise the content for the right device when customers want it. But what is the right content and when is the right time? Create tailored experiences by providing personalised deals. This type of personalisation is only possible with a powerful analytics solution that collects the right data and lets you visualise how that data is connected to engagement and customer behaviour.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Control</h4>

<p dir="ltr">When it comes to control in freeriding, the question goes: was the run under control even on rough terrain and after big jumps? In branding, organizations have control over their brand to some extent, but in the end it is all about entering into conversation with your <a href="http://www.marketing-trends-congress.com/archives/2008/Materiali/Paper/Fr/Muhlbacher_Hemetsberger.pdf">customers who co-construct the brand meaning</a>. This happens in a social discourse.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Technique</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Technique and control go hand in hand. Poor technique will be sanctioned only if it leads to control issues. A rider with personal technique which might not be academic, will not be penalized if they are totally in control. In branding there are tons of ways to build a brand. You just need to choose the right technique. In your questing after a successful branding strategy, above all, remember to ask yourself one thing: am I coherent across all brand touchpoints?</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">The secret ingredient</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Several years as a freeride athlete have given me enormous amount of knowledge, skills and abilities, which can be applied in business context. These include quality awareness, goal-orientedness and proactiveness. Being a freeride athlete is a sweet mixture of controlling your body and mind, but, above all, you need to <a href="http://cdn2.geckoandfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/steve-jobs-quotes-creative-apple-design-26.jpg">follow your intuition</a>. It’s the secret ingredient, that helps you to put the pieces together on the mountains and in the business world.</p>

      <title>Code club mentoring experiences</title>
      <description>A bunch of Futuriceans taught programming to school children on weekly code club sessions. We are sharing the teaching material that we prepared.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months I and a few of my colleagues have taught programming to upper comprehensive school students (aged 13-15) in a series of weekly code club sessions. We started from the very beginning assuming no previous programming knowledge and ended up flying drones!</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Mentoring experiences</h2>

<p>We held eight weekly code club sessions at <a href="http://www.eschool.edu.hel.fi/">the English School</a>. Each session lasted one and a half hours and was scheduled after students’ regular school day. There were usually two and sometimes more Futurice mentors present.</p>

<p>The first sessions introduced basic programming constructs such as variables, functions, loops and other control flows. In the later sessions, the students got to apply these building blocks in solving various tasks.</p>

<p>In the beginning of each session we briefly explained the concepts we wanted them to learn, but otherwise we let the students start coding straight away. The first exercise of each session was a recap from the previous week’s topic. The students were free to advance at their own pace and they were not required to complete every exercise. The final exercises in each session were usually more open-ended so that those who managed to complete all other exercises in the allocated time could explore them in more depth. Throughout the sessions, the main role of the mentors was to help the students when they got stuck.</p>

<p>We also held other types of sessions that went beyond typing code on a computer. One time the students got to pilot a small toy robot and another time they got to fly a drone. Students were really excited when they got to program a robot to drive around a track. Programming the drone to fly was actually less interesting, maybe because it had to be done on a different language than the rest of the exercises and the limited accuracy of the drone made it difficult to control it towards the target.</p>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Will the robot stay inside the track? Photo credit: Yrjö Kari-Koskinen</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We prepared exercises for each week’s session in the week before. We brainstormed ideas for the exercises collaboratively and decided who will implement which exercise. A day or two before the code club session, when the exercises were ready, we tried them out and gave feedback for each other’s exercises and made final amendments.</p>

<p>Both planning the exercises and seeing the kids carry them out was really fun. We often started preparing an exercise with only a vague theme in mind. The exercise emerged from lots of experimentation and playing. But this is exactly what we wanted to tell the students: programming is a creative endeavor. Seeing the students get the hang of programming and apply their newly learned skills reminded me of how I felt when I was a kid and learnt programming: that unlimited possibilities had opened up.</p>

</figure>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">We are sharing the teaching material</h2>

<p>Teachers, IT professionals and anyone else is welcome to use the material we have created to teach children programming. You can try out the exercises right now at the <a href="https://codeclub.herokuapp.com/">Chilicorn code club</a>. Adopting the material is easy: open the page and start coding.</p>

<p>The code club web page contains a code editor and a window for displaying graphics. More exercises can be loaded from a menu. Exercises consist of some instructions and partial Python code which the student has to complete. The student is also free to start from a clean plate and build something on her own.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/codeclub2_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="A screenshot showing a code editor on the left and a drawing produced by the program on the right." src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/codeclub2_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">The Chilicorn code club web page.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In most exercises the goal is to draw something, because seeing the results visually gives instant feedback. Drawing is done with a turtle library similar to the <a href="https://turtle-roy.herokuapp.com/">Turtle Roy</a> environment that is commonly used in code schools for smaller children.</p>

<p><a href="http://koodi2016.fi/">Programming will be part of the elementary school curriculum</a> in Finland starting Fall 2016. We at Futurice wanted to help teachers develop course material for grades 7-9. There is plenty of teaching material (mainly on graphical programming languages) available for younger children (for example at <a href="http://www.koodikoulu.fi/">koodikoulu.fi</a>). However, far less material is available that is suitable for upper comprehensive school level and for learning text-based programming.</p>

<p>The curriculum states that in grades 7-9 the students will be expected to learn a text-based programming language. Our exercises are using the Python language because it is easy to learn, is available on many different environments and extends readily to large programs. Many of the exercises involve mathematical concepts because programming will be part of the math education in Finland.</p>

<p>We encourage anyone who is interested to mentor code club sessions at their local school. While no previous programming experience is assumed from students, a prospective mentor should have at least a basic level of expertise with Python. Necessary level of skills can be obtained by doing the exercises yourself, perhaps together with a friend who already knows programming.</p>

<p>The exercises could surely be improved further. They could be translated into Finnish and integrated more tightly with the elementary school curriculum. If you want to help improve the material, submit a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/futurice/PythonInBrowser">project’s GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the English School for letting us hold the code clubs and to the <a href="http://spiceprogram.org/">Spice Program</a>, the social impact program of Futurice, for sponsoring employees’ spare time contributions to digital education.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For the last few months a team at Futurice has been working on an exciting project called Vör. By placing multiple beacons and sensors around the Futurice office in Helsinki, we have explored possibilities on how to improve the office experience that the new age of IoT (Internet of Things) will one day provide to all of us.</p>

<div class="article__embed-code">What is this upcoming Technology Megatrend that we hear more and more about? IoT is the network of physical objects - devices, vehicles, buildings and other items which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, that enables these objects to collect and exchange data <sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">1</a>]</sup>.</div>

<p dir="ltr">According to Simona Jankowski, Senior Equity research Analyst, Goldman Sachs:</p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Companies’ ability to adapt and thrive in this new era of the Internet of Things is very likely to determine who the next set of winners and laggards will be in this new connected age. <sup>[<a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/iot-video.html">2</a>]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p dir="ltr">In order to be one of the winners of the next innovation chapter, we at Futurice envisioned Vör.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The name Vör comes from Norse mythology and is a goddess associated with wisdom and sentientness and also represents core values of office Vör - connectivity, awareness and safety. Vör is an open source tool that offers a new kind of smart office experience by creating seamless connections between people within the office space. Implemented features focus on two aspects - share and find. Currently it provides relevant information about your surroundings like who is near you, is there something special on a Futucafé table, find an empty bathroom nearby, greatest shots at the pool table. Vör is still expanding with other exciting services. Rather than telling you, let us show you what we have implemented:</p>

<div class="article__embed-code"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/154193491" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></div>

<p dir="ltr">During the development process people at our office came up with many amazing ideas for Vör. Am I the last person at the office? Where’s my stuff? Where’s the quietest spot right now? Are any of my favorite workspaces available? Looking for a lunch partner? These and many other ideas are our long term vision and can be implemented in your office in accordance to your particular needs and wishes. You can contribute with code, feedback and ideas to the project on Github to join forces and one day make it happen.</p>

We’ve taken the best bits from Lean Startup, combined it with thoughts from <a href="http://leanstack.com/running-lean-book/">Ash Maurya</a>, embraced Design Thinking and merged the results with Agile Software Engineering practices to produce Lean Service Creation, our way of working.</p>

<p>The other night my colleague <a href="http://futurice.com/people/tom-mcqueen">Tom McQueen</a> and I had dinner with <a href="http://startupsauna.com/coaches/will-cardwell">Will Cardwell</a>. Will asked us about the way we work and once we’d explained it, he surprised us by talking about an entrepreneurial and innovation thought framework called <a href="http://effectuation.org/">Effectuation</a>. Having heard the pitch, we had to dig in to really understand what it’s about and if we could utilise it in our work. What follows here is a brief summary of our reading about Effectuation.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">What’s effectuation?</h4>

<p>Effectuation is a principle introduced by Saras Sarasvathy in 2001 as part of her research at Carnegie-Mellon University. Lately, a rivalry has sprung up between this thought framework and the Stanford University/Silicon-Valley based Lean Startup framework, both competing for attention as the thinking model for aspiring entrepreneurs. It’s like a throwback to the East Coast - West Coast Hip Hop wars of the 90s. The battle for attention has not, thankfully, resulted in any drive-by shootings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tonpantoja/effectuation-entrepreneurship-13205143">Anthony Pantoja</a> summarises it neatly: “Imagining new ends using a given set of means”. It contrasts with typical business planning where causal thinking is typically applied by choosing best means to achieve a goal.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Is it similar to Lean Startup?</h4>

<p>Effectuation starts with Bird in Hand - which means starting out with your means and an achievable goal in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who am I?</li>
	<li>What I know?</li>
	<li>Whom I know?</li>
</ul>

<p>That sounds somewhat similar to the “find a problem worth solving” and “get out of the building” principles used in Lean Startup.</p>

<p>The framework continues with</p>

<ol>
	<li>Evaluating affordable loss, which means evaluating problems worth solving by whether the downside in these opportunities is affordable.</li>
	<li>Lemonade: Embrace surprises and be flexible. Lean Startup talks about pivoting.</li>
	<li>Crazy Quilt: Build partnerships with people.</li>
	<li>Pilot in plane: Focus on activities that you can control. Future is not found or predicted, but it is made.</li>
</ol>

<p>A simplified comparison of these to Lean Startup:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Affordable loss = Revenue/Loss in Lean Canvas</li>
	<li>Lemonade = Pivot</li>
	<li>Crazy Quilt = Get out of the building, partnerships/customers in Lean Canvas</li>
	<li>Pilot in plane = Validation</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">What does it all mean?</h4>

<p>While there seem to be similarities in both of these frameworks, I’m thinking the essence of Effectuation is what we at Futurice tend to call “Hustling”.</p>

<p>Roughly, it refers to reaching out to people and trying to identify the ones we could potentially help with our skills in digital business, design and tech, and then iterating our approach based on feedback and findings. Incidentally, this is how we’ve been building our business at Futurice’s London office, so we’re accidental practitioners of Effectuation. Have we made innovations along the way? Maybe nothing grand, but we’ve certainly gained valuable knowledge on what types of skills and services we as a company want to offer in the UK market.</p>

<p>Compared to Lean Startup, Hustling is the major difference. Rather than trying to map a potential customer, and a problem to solve to a canvas, an innovation is born out of reaching out to people you know and talking to them about topics that you know something about. And avoiding risks you cannot afford.</p>

<p>I can personally say I like this way of thinking as it resonates with my thoughts about validating new product ideas by selling them first before investing massive sums of money in product development. It may have the potential to develop into a more formal framework for innovation or not - it’ll be interesting to see.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">This year started for me with an impatiently anticipated event. Two of the places I planned to visit at some point in my life merged together in space and time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Awwwards conference, known by many digital professionals thanks to the <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards.com</a> website, was held this year in laid-back Amsterdam. Such a mixture of high quality inspiration, knowledge sharing and overall time well-spent would have been a shame to miss.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/screen-shot-2016-01-30-at-13-47-26_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>
</figure>

<p dir="ltr">Now, while waiting for my flight back to Helsinki, I can finally take a break and focus on the exciting past two days. Getting out there is crucial for any creative person. Simply to get a fresh perspective on things, a dose of inspiration and let your mind have a proper stir up.</p>

<p dir="ltr"> </p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">The most memorable highlights</h4>

<p>When keeping your eyes wide open, it’s generally hard to miss a thing. But many would agree that conferences often are rather exhausting. Non-stop flow of information, visual porn and artistic videos almost causing epileptic seizures make you a bit high after a while. Nevertheless, some talks have a stronger impact than others. </p>

<p>Here are my top five highlights of this weekend. </p>

<p class="article__paragraph"><strong>First day</strong> started with</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/jbrewer">Josh Brewer</a>, the former Principal Designer of Twitter, going through "The Centrality of Design". It's truly a balm to every designer's soul seeing how the design industry adapts and evolves to the evergrowing demand from all the adjacent fields. Josh gave a holistic overview of what is happening in the digital industry, what are the pitfalls and most promising directions to follow.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/josh_brewer_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>
</figure>

<ul>
	<li>Then, <a href="https://twitter.com/anrick">Anrick Bregman</a> from <a href="http://www.unit9.com/">Unit9</a> showcased an impressive way to create VR with 360º immersive cameras and CGI. Their website is a gemstone for people into VR and technology. Check out the <a href="http://www.unit9.com/project/lexus-elevate">Lexus Elevate project</a> and A Survival Experience for Oculus Rift below</li>
</ul>

<p class="article__paragraph"><em>Every person living in Finland plays that Storm game 8 months out of the year :) </em></p>

<p class="article__paragraph"> </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="article__paragraph"><a href="https://twitter.com/daafje">David Vogel</a>, rooted his UX Design related talk back to the ideas of Plato and Aristotle on Holism and Reductionism. Two contrary concepts, using the relationships between the components; their interconnectedness, interdependencies and interactions, contributing to the understanding of the whole piece. In relation to UX methods and processes, this point of view, was an eye-opening interpretation. My perception of a User Experience Flow Map will never be the same.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="article__paragraph"> </p>

<ul>
	<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/BartvdWiele">Bart Van de Wiele</a> presented an upcoming Adobe product, Project Comet. I've been looking forward to seeing the live performance of this tool and it didn't dissapoint! My guess: every UX Designer will have it at their disposal once the beta is out. It's as if Sketch and Principle had a baby. They should have called it Skenciple. </li>
</ul>

<div class="article__embed-code"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPCBUmAOy7M" width="560"></iframe></div>

<p class="article__paragraph"><a href="https://twitter.com/arnii_dk">Bjarne Christensen</a> from <a href="https://stupid-studio.com/">StupidStudio</a> gave a very insightful, energetic talk of how to handle client relationships with everyone's interest in mind and aim for project's success. Bjarne totally stole my attention with his charisma and eye-catching content, so I sort of forgot to take notes and photos )</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

<p class="article__paragraph"> </p>

<p class="article__paragraph">The rest 13 were as exciting as the mentioned five. But if I put them all here, someone might come after me for not being down to the point ;) In any case, make sure to take a look at <a href="http://conference.awwwards.com/amsterdam-2016/schedule/">the full program</a> and check out the rest by yourself.</p>

<p class="article__paragraph"> </p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">The takeaways</h4>

<p class="article__paragraph">What's great about events like this, gathering together the best of the best among passionate pixel visionaries and industry evangelists, is the range of choices. Choices that help you obtain what's lost or missing. Whether it's just a sense of inspiration, tips to master a new technology or terra incognita in the adjacent practices. Contrary to popular belief, a conference never feels like a holiday, but it fuels you up for future achievements.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://conference.awwwards.com/nyc-2016/">next Awwwards event</a> is scheduled for mid-June in New York. If you still wonder whether it's a worthy experience...stop wondering, it's totally badass.</p>

<p>Gates are closing in 30 minutes...oops I better run now. </p>

<p>I recently made an order on Liberty London’s website. They have a required field for title that totals 33 options*, and one of them is <em>other</em>. What an exciting day, when a Liberty customer doesn’t find one of the 33 titles applicable to themselves. I recall registering as a marchioness, but that was only so my colleagues would start rumours about my nobility status when the package arrived in the office. ​</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/liberty-titles--atyscnr9r3_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">33 titles, but Mx ain't one</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One thing that was not a required field on the order form was gender, and in this blog post I’ll cover some basics of gender and titles on forms, and what you need to know (and do) about inclusivity in this subject in 2016.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2"><strong>Gender in online forms</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">In Germany <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/pstg/BJNR012210007.html">it’s possible to have no official sex</a> on your birth certificate, and in Australia, any official body that collects information on people’s sex or gender <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Documents/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender.PDF">has to include an option for <em>unspecified</em></a>. Here in the UK works are in progress to make room for non-specified sex on people’s passports. Since fairly recently, India allows for people to self-identify as a third gender. So if the largest democracy on earth can push through legislation that allows for this, surely your online shopping cart can handle it?</p>

<p>In the UK, sex (someone's biological sex, that is) is a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/1">protected characteristic</a>. This means that you can’t treat someone differently because they were born a man or a woman. Technically, gender (male or female characteristics) is not protected, so you can ask people about that on your online forms, but hear me out: who cares about the law? The reason you shouldn’t be asking your customers for their sex or gender, is because you probably don’t really need it.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise to you that a lot of people don’t identify as either male or female, but fit into other categories. Any form that fails to take this into account, can exclude and marginalise those customers. The best way to take it into account, is simply by not asking for it. Instead ask yourself what is the business rationale for collecting this data. A simple “for demographic information” is not necessarily a reason. If you want to improve your product suggestions, the algorithms that tell you which products the person previously browsed or searched for probably tells more about their shopping preferences than their gender. If you don’t ask your customers about their gender when they come to your store in person, you don’t need to ask about it online.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Examples of gender in forms</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">If you register to vote in Australia, you’ll find three options for gender, as they are required to by law.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/australia-voter-registration_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Unspecified gender is a required field in Australian official forms</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Norwegian airline, on the other hand, have a cumbersome and confusing registration page. They’re making gender a required field, and have other confusing fields (country is mentioned twice).</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/norwegian-airlines_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Norwegian misses the mark here, offering only two options and making gender a required field</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p dir="ltr">In some cases, there are legal requirements to provide information about sex. In the below screengrab, you can see that the Common Application for universities in the States provides more information about why they are asking for the user’s sex, and where they can give more information.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">The Common Application offers an explanation for why they require information about your sex</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>What you can do if you design or build forms</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Make gender information on forms optional, or don’t ask for it at all, if you don’t really, really need it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Use the term <em>gender</em> over the term <em>sex</em>, unless it’s necessary to know someone’s biological sex (e.g. for medical reasons)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">If you’re a developer, tester or designer, question the need for this information on forms, and suggest more gender neutral language</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">If you do ask for gender, consider using self-identification: (e.g. <em>Gender: _________</em>) rather than offering only two options. Alternatively, you can offer an option for <em>prefer not to say</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">If you do use specific options, you can use:</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>​female</li>
	<li>male</li>
	<li>other (please specify):______________</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>If you want to offer a more complete list, the <a href="http://www.hrc.org/resources/collecting-transgender-inclusive-gender-data-in-workplace-and-other-surveys">HRC</a> (Human Rights Campaign) offers this suggestion:</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li><em>female</em></li>
	<li><em>male</em></li>
	<li><em>genderqueer/androgynous</em></li>
	<li><em>intersex</em></li>
	<li><em>transgender</em></li>
	<li><em>transsexual</em></li>
	<li><em>cross-dresser</em></li>
	<li><em>FTM (female-to-male)</em></li>
	<li><em>MTF (male-to-female)</em></li>
	<li><em>other (please specify) ______________</em></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2"><strong>Titles in online forms</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Depending on where you live, you might be used to seeing titles in online forms (often called <em>prefixes</em> in American English). The Liberty example is not the worst either. If you register at Singapore Airlines they offer you an astounding 57 title options in a drop-down menu. If you select <em>Miss </em>or <em>Mrs</em>, the gender button switches to female, but as soon as you get into the <em>Dr </em>and <em>Professor</em> titles, the gender button jumps back to male. <em>Duchess</em> also defaults to male though, so maybe they’re more open-minded than we think.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/krisflyer--4u1vcgm1g0_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/krisflyer--4u1vcgm1g0_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">I'm registering as the Queen of Saba</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p dir="ltr">On the other side of the spectrum we have a screengrab of the De Beers sign up form. Personally I don’t think you need titles at all, but this form nicely accounts for those who do. It’s both optional and open, so you can put in whatever you like. They’ll include a title in future communications if you felt it was important to register with one, otherwise they’ll just use your name. They don’t ask about your gender because they don’t need it. If you want to buy diamonds, they’re OK with selling them to you without knowing about your gender. They don’t make you write your email address twice either, so well done, De Beers.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Well done, De Beers</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>Mx</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Some are also embracing a newer, gender neutral title,<em> Mx</em> (pronounced <em>mux</em>), so if you want a finite list of titles, it would be wise to include that one too. In the UK Royal Mail uses <em>Mx</em> as one of the titles you can sign up with.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/royal-mail_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Royal Mail allows a Mx to sign up</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">What you can do if you design or build forms</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Don’t make title a required field</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">If you want a title or prefix, leave it blank to be filled in by the user</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">If you want to use a defined list of titles, include at least <em>Ms</em>, <em>Miss</em>, <em>Mr</em>, <em>Mrs</em> and <em>Mx</em>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">You don’t need 57 titles. If the queen wants to sign up, she will probably just have someone call you. Instead, account for the thousands who would prefer the title Mx.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">In general, accounting for marginal preferences and inclusivity may not seem a priority for you, and it may be that it hasn’t been necessary for you in the past. But following the advice laid out above is more or less free. If you design a form with required fields, then all your potential users should be able to answer one of those options, and not be forced to choose something they don’t identify with. Using this advice in surveys can also help you not exclude people who won’t be bothered to answer your questions, because you’re not bothered with including their options in your forms.</p>

<p>Every time you request information from people, make sure it’s really needed, because privacy and time are two of the most precious commodities we have today, and in small ways you may be asking for a bit of both from your users.</p>

<p> </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>How to prepare for cases where several teams or teams depend on other teams to produce a layer of architecture that enables their work? SAFe is a powerful model, but when scaling up, you need to make sure you are doing so on a solid foundation. This post presents a way for your teams to evaluate their agile profile.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Agile Software development 101</h4>

<p>Agile software development methodologies have long ago become mainstream in the industry. The drive to digitalize business has companies both small and large keeping their digital inventories small, reducing time to market and most importantly focusing on doing the things which create most value first.</p>

<p>In agile software projects we have an empowered fixed team, preferably cross-disciplined, working on a prioritized backlog of business items for a fixed period of time. Within the given timebox the team will complete always the most important things iteratively using a PDCA cycle such as Scrum to constantly improve its working practices.</p>

<p>The team will have a Product Owner who is able to distill the backlog items from all the related stakeholders and pass them to the team. In addition, the team will have a Scrum Master or Agile Coach whose job it is to monitor their way of working and to remove impediments.</p>

<p>The above process coupled with a commonly understood Definition of Done should produce software that solves the most important business problem with constant quality while keeping the schedule. Most of us have also experienced that it works in practice in the projects with typical 5 to 9 people team. In other words, keeping things in scale of a project.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">SAFe - Agile Principles in Large Scale</h4>

<p>The issues I mentioned in the intro are usually found in the problem domain of larger companies. Conveniently, those are also the issues which Scaled Agile Framework tries to solve. So, maybe at this stage it would make sense to present the big picture of Scaled Agile and try to make some sense of it. Here is a picture how Scaled Agile Inc. likes to present its solution:</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/safe40_4levels_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/safe40_4levels_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">SAFe 4.0 4 levels</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><br>
As you can see there are a lot of roles, lot of moving parts and several levels. In fact, describing those would warrant a series of posts and it is also something we’re looking at later on in the series. For now, we just need to find a contact point that’s guaranteed to be found from any organization producing software: The (hopefully agile) Team.</p>

<p>Team is the level that produces the tangible results, the potentially shippable product increments. In companies the Team level is the most likely level to be run using agile practices so they likely have experience with iterative work. To handle products, portfolio and budgets companies usually have their in-house practices which often have evolved in the era where agile methodologies were still in their infancy. Since the iteration is the foundation stone of all agility it makes also sense to make sure the basics are in good shape on the Team level before we start scaling things up.</p>

<p>On the Team level day-to-day work on a SAFe-enabled organization should not be too different from any other Agile software project. Each team has its Product Owner, Scrum Master and a mix of cross-disciplined, talented team members. The only difference is the added awareness of other Teams and more structured way of making architectural decisions and timing enablers and features. But let’s not go there yet. Right now we’re still in the state where the Team is working on something they can handle all by themselves or maybe we have a bunch of teams all working without alignment. No matter the exact starting setup, we want to scale up so we need to make sure the agile foundation is in shape.</p>

<h4 class="article__heading--h4">Finding out the Current State</h4>

<p>One of the nice things in the toolbox of the SAFe agilist is a Team Agility Assessment Chart which helps teams to quickly do a self-assessment and create a profile of their working practices. The chart I’m presenting here is pretty much the vanilla assessment chart from SAFe which in my opinion is a good way to start. There are a couple of pitfalls when it comes to self-assessment, though. First of all, you need to make it clear that no bonuses or other incentives are tied to this assessment. The reasons should be obvious, but it’s something that’s good to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Secondly, people have different standards based on their experience and other factors. Just keep in mind that in the less quantifiable assessment parts it’s important to understand where the team is coming from. World Class teams could be comparing their way of working to the very best in the industry while other teams might not yet have seen more efficient ways of working. Clearly measurable goals and examples of them help here. It’s also a good idea to ask the teams to elaborate how they reached a specific grade in the assessment to support the resulting team profile.</p>

<p>Below is an example of how a Team Agility Radar might look like:</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/agilityradar_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/agilityradar_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Team Agility Assessment Radar</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Team Agility Radar shows a profile that is perhaps common for Teams that are working with Agile Methodologies in a small scale environment. Regardless of where the team is coming from the radar shows areas which the team has not been focusing on. As a proponent of SAFe you will be happy to know that you now have insight where SAFe can bring value on the Team level and how you can likely to get the buy-in from the teams. Success or failure here is important as it sets the tone of your agile transformation on the grassroots level.</p>

<p>For your convenience I’ll provide you with an Excel template that will generate the above graph. If this subject interests you I’d recommend to read Dean Leffingwell’s Scaling Software Agility: Best Practices for Large Enterprises. If you liked this post, you’ll find especially chapters 21 and 22 useful.</p>

      <description>This small hack is the best alternative for the Paste and Match Style feature missing from Photoshop.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>This trick seems so deceptively trivial that I only made the daring decision to share it with the world after having had a couple of beers on a week evening and being overly optimistic about everything. At the same time, it's made a significant difference to my productivity in many cases, so I hope it will help others as well. </p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">The Problem</h2>

<p>Photoshop is still missing a Paste–Text–and–Match–Style function, despite many users desperately screaming for one. There are many cases when that is needed, the common pattern being that you have a styled text object into which you want to paste text from somewhere else, discarding any styling that text might already have.</p>

<p>The mainstream recommended workaround is to first copy–paste the incorrectly–styled text into a plain text editor to remove the styling, then copy the text from there, switch back to Photoshop and paste into your correctly–styled text object.</p>

<p>That solution is far from ideal. Although not perfect either, this small hack at least takes it one step forward: no need to open a separate text editor. Just use Photoshop itself. Here's how it works:</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">The Solution</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
<strong>Copy the text</strong> you need to paste, from wherever (web, other app, other Photoshop file).</li>
	<li>
<strong>Select</strong> the Ps <strong>Type tool</strong> (you would be doing this anyway, because you're pasting into a text object). </li>
	<li>
<strong>Paste into the Font drop-down</strong>. (this is the "hack" part)</li>
	<li>
<strong>Select All</strong> from the Font drop-down and <strong>Copy</strong> again.</li>
	<li>Hit <strong>Escape</strong>. (to revert the Font drop-down selection to what it was before and prevent getting an error) </li>
	<li>
<strong>Paste </strong>into your destination text object.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><a class="article__figure__link" data-type="image" href="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/paste-and-match-style-replacement-photoshop_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/paste-and-match-style-replacement-photoshop_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></a></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">Paste and match style replacement hack, steps</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Why it works</h2>

<p>The Font drop–down, like most text input elements in most software, is plain text, just like a plain text editor. So it too will remove styling when copy–pasting into it, leaving you with unstyled text, ready for the final move. As a bonus, the Font drop–down also accepts multi–line text, so you can use it to unstyle any length of text.</p>

<h2 class="article__heading--h2">Other Uses</h2>

<p>This technique can be used in any software where the "Paste without style" function is missing. And of course it's not limited to the Ps Type tool input for unstyling the text. For example, the Spotlight search field can be used on Macs, or Chrome's URL bar, or whatever text input is most convenient. </p>

<p>Well, hope this helps. If it does, remember to tell your designer friends! </p>

      <title>API services &amp; MVC</title>
      <description>MVC (or Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern on which to build software. The basic idea in it is to separate internal data models from the user interface via the controller and view. It is dominating web and mobile development, and although some alternatives exist, almost all relevant server-side software is developed with an MVC-compliant (or an MVC-variant-compliant) framework. The thing is, MVC is made for full-stack development, where the software consists of the database, user interface and business logic.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">You might have heard of this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> before, maybe you read about it in 1988 in The Journal of Object Oriented Programming, or you were a fanatic user of <a href="https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps112/Spring03/readings/Ingalls78.html">Smalltalk-76</a> in the 1970s? Or maybe you are (or work with) an aspiring software developer, in the business of modern web and mobile applications.</p>

<p dir="ltr">MVC (or Model-View-Controller) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern">architectural pattern</a> on which to build software. The basic idea in it is to separate internal data models from the user interface via the controller and view. It is dominating web and mobile development, and although some alternatives exist, almost all relevant server-side software is developed with an MVC-compliant (or an MVC-variant-compliant) framework.</p>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">A typical representation of the MVC pattern</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3">You should care because</h3>

<p>The thing is, MVC is made for full-stack development, where the software consists of the database, user interface and business logic. But, consider for a second, the use case of most mobile applications. Yes, in most cases the MVC-stack is present, but it is no longer the same as it once was. The client application is the view, the backend is the controller and the database is the model. Now as a self-proclaimed backend developer I’m going to focus on the backend part of said use case.</p>

<figure class="article__figure">
<div class="article__figure__placeholder"><img alt="" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/1992/mvc_modern--gw3naf9le8_s600x0_q85_noupscale.png"></div>

<figcaption><span class="article__figure__caption">What MVC actually looks like now</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course the above diagram still follows the principles of MVC, the problem comes when you expand one of those pieces, namely the backend. In that piece of the MVC you can most certainly find another implementation of the MVC pattern, with abstracted database implementations and endpoints. This would be okay if all parts of the backend are fairly complex, but most of the time it’s made up of a few steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Get request for some data</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Find said data in database</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Convert said data to correct format</p>
	</li>
	<li>Return said data</li>
</ol>

<p>These sorts of cases seem more like a pipeline than a complex multi-layer application to me, and makes me wonder why would you build a server-side API application following the MVC pattern in these cases. If you could significantly reduce the complexity and size of the application with a simple pattern shift, shouldn’t you do it? </p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>Example case</strong></h3>

<p>Let’s say you have a very standard setup where you have some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> database, a mobile client of operating system X and then a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> <a href="https://playframework.com/">Play</a> 2.X backend. Now you notice that Play is a framework intended for use with the MVC architecture (as most backend frameworks are at the moment) and can be used either with mobile clients as an API or as a stand-alone web application. Our example client calls the backend with the call: </p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div style="background: whitesmoke; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em; font-size: 0.8em;">
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #00aaaa">HTTP</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">GET</span> https<span style="color: #00aaaa">://</span>our.mobileclient.com/users
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>Now what happens in the backend is that first the Play application checks the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaRouting">routes</a>-file to see where that URL is mapped to (the first part of the view-layer in Play):</p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div style="background: whitesmoke; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em; font-size: 0.8em;">
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">GET</span>   /users          controllers.<span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">HelloClient</span>.users
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>From there we can see that the actual view is in the controller HelloClient. When building a stand-alone web application, the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaActions">Controller</a> is equivalent to MVC's controller, but in the case of an API it's more of a hybrid between a view and a controller:</p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div style="background: whitesmoke; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em; font-size: 0.8em;">
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #0000aa">object</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">HelloClient</span> <span style="color: #0000aa">extends</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">Controller</span> {
  <span style="color: #0000aa">def</span> users <span style="color: #0000aa">=</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">Action</span> {
      <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">Ok</span>(<span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">HelloService</span>.getAll)
  }
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>And inside the Service we find that it's just routing the call to the model and transforming it to JSON. A level such as Services isn't necessary in a Play application, but it is a place where you can put the business logic in, to keep concerns nicely separated. HelloService could look something like this:</p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div style="background: whitesmoke; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em; font-size: 0.8em;">
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #0000aa">object</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">HelloService</span> {
   <span style="color: #0000aa">def</span> getAll<span style="color: #0000aa">:</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">JSON</span> = {
     <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">UserRepository</span>.getAll.toJson
   }
 }
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>And now, finally, we get to the model part, which would seem to be a two-part layer, where UserRepository defines the actual storing (in the database), and User is the class that defines the actual model. UserRepository here is missing it's two <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaAnorm">helper functions "userParser" and "rowToUser"</a> which are used to translate stuff the SQL library gives us into a User-object. But overall they would look something like this:</p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div style="background: whitesmoke; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em; font-size: 0.8em;">
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #0000aa">case</span> <span style="color: #0000aa">class</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">User</span>(id<span style="color: #0000aa">:</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">UUID</span>, name<span style="color: #0000aa">:</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">String</span>)

<span style="color: #0000aa">object</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">UserRepository</span> {
  <span style="color: #0000aa">def</span> getAll<span style="color: #0000aa">:</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">List</span>[<span style="color: #00aaaa">User</span>] <span style="color: #0000aa">=</span>
    <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">DB</span>.withConnection {
      <span style="color: #0000aa">implicit</span> c <span style="color: #0000aa">=&gt;</span>
        <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">SQL</span>”select * from user_account”
          .as(userParser.*)
          .flatMap(rowToUser)
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>To someone who has some experience with Scala this may be a fairly normal approach, but as I first laid my eyes upon this architecture, it got me thinking that surely this isn’t the best way to do such stuff. Thinking about it a mobile backend API only has to provide the API, and the payload (and of course some logic, but that’s not in all the cases).</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>What if it looked something like this</strong></h3>

<p class="article__paragraph">What if we had a framework that allowed us to flatten the architecture almost completely? After noticing that most of our calls (or in this case the single call) is just a direct pipeline from database to return, we remove all the copypasta and let the framework handle the repetitive stuff. Working our way from the bottom up, we abstract the database connection altogether (it will be defined in <em><a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Configuration">application.conf</a> </em>or a similar file). The model only needs to know what table the data is located in, and the framework handles the rest. </p>

<p> </p>

<div class="article__embed-code">
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div style="background: whitesmoke; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em; font-size: 0.8em;">
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #888888">@table</span>(”user_account”)
<span style="color: #0000aa">case</span> <span style="color: #0000aa">class</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">User</span>(id<span style="color: #0000aa">:</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">UUID</span>, name<span style="color: #0000aa">:</span> <span style="color: #00aaaa">String</span>) <span style="color: #0000aa">extends</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">JsonModel</span> <span style="color: #0000aa">with</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">DBConnection</span>

<span style="color: #0000aa">object</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">User</span> <span style="color: #0000aa">extends</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">EndPoint</span> {

  <span style="color: #0000aa">def</span> users <span style="color: #0000aa">=</span> <span style="color: #00aa00; text-decoration: underline">Action</span> {

  }
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p dir="ltr"> </p>

<p dir="ltr">Now the companion object is where the endpoint magic happens. The annotation tells what route this function responds to, Ok is the response type and findAll is a function that returns a list of users, which the framework translates to JSON. Of course all of this expects the variables to be named the same way in all levels (JSON, database and model).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now what if we want to include some more functionality to our program? Say we want to find all users with book loans and return a list of users with a list of their loaned books, for example. This is the case where a model is not the best solution, but extra logic is called for, so just add the correct class and work there.</p>

<p>So the example pattern proposed here would boil down to Models &amp; Services where most calls go directly to the models, taxing the server application as little as possible, and then the calls that require some extra functionality are the ones we work in.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>So I have this library called [insert library name]</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, there are libraries (mostly for JavaScript) that implement some or all of the requirements expressed here and you can use those to implement the Models &amp; Services-pattern in your application. I personally don't like combining applications together from multiple little libraries, preferring instead a semi-ready framework, to avoid compatibility problems.</p>

<p>I did spend a few days scouring the internet for frameworks that would implement just about anything other than MVC, but my search only turned up JavaScript libraries. Also, I stumbled on the fact that most <a href="http://hotframeworks.com/">popular</a> and <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/framework">used</a> frameworks on the internet tend to be MVC. So if you do find something give me a holler on <a href="https://twitter.com/laurilavanti" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>What I’m talking about here is more about changing the entire mindset and pattern when starting work on an API backend. Yes, you could do a flattish architecture in for example Scala, but you would still need to make the abstractions of databases and routes yourself, or endure extremely bloated models. This would very much undermine the usefulness of the flat architecture, trading maintainability for flatness.</p>

<h3 class="article__heading--h3"><strong>In conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>Although this is just a napkin-scribble-level proposition, I find the idea of a lightweight optimized (for API applications) pattern very alluring. And even though memory or CPU isn’t as valuable nowadays I believe this sort of solution would save a lot of grey hairs in revisions and would significantly ease the pain of creating a new application. </p>

<p><strong>Pros of Models &amp; Services:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Higher abstraction level =&gt; comprehensibility</li>
	<li>Flat architecture =&gt; maintainablity</li>
	<li>Overall simplicity =&gt; models allow for simplistic end-to-end use of the API with minimal implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pros of MVC:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Lower abstraction level =&gt; controllability</li>
	<li>Widely used =&gt; ease of handover</li>
	<li>Many implementations =&gt; tested and understood</li>
</ul>

<p><em>* Of course not all endpoints are as simple as that, but I propose that those are the exceptions, and the needs of the few should not incur in to a new layer in the whole architecture.</em></p>
